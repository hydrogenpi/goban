PW[Lee Sedol]PB[Alphago]WR[9p]DT[2016-03-13]EV[Deep Mind Challenge Match]RO[4]PC[Four Seasons Hotel, Seoul, South Korea]US[Still me]C[Tictactoe [-\]: I have determined that alphago should be considered 0p ( zero pee), and welcome viewing the next game
Meloe [-\]: hi
Meloe [-\]: ty to relay the games for us 
Tictactoe [-\]: it's great for the kgs-archives to have these games stored, hopefully i can make another flawless relay today
wolvie [?\]: You've been doing an excellent job :D
Meloe [-\]: yes 
Meloe [-\]: when will they play the last one ?
Rinnon [5k?\]: Two days from now.
Meloe [-\]: ok , they have a day free
Meloe [-\]: free dey 
zampa [-\]: its 5am here been up all night for all games.
zampa [-\]: i completely turned my day around to catch em live.
Tictactoe [-\]: sure i am looking forward already to a day off ^^
oonicks: i slept 12 hours or so after the last match:)
oonicks: this game may be a very nice one to watch is my guess
oonicks: there is nothing anymore lee can proof, so he can do whatever he likes
oonicks: or maybe lee will try to find out how many points is really the difference between them
oonicks: i dont think that would work so well ..
Tictactoe [-\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw
hongsuu: wow, already alphago game number 4?
djo666 [3k\]: salut
rsun [-\]: alphago as b means we will see an eye-opening fuseki
Meloe [-\]: eye-opening ?
oonicks: will open 3 4 i think.
hongsuu: man, i was 2k, then i saw redmond comments in the 3 matches, i got into 2d kgs fast
hongsuu: thanks alphago
wry [3d\]: *banana dance*
hongsuu: wait wait, is this the game or only commenting old game?
Trevoke [?\]: hongsuu: this will be Game 4
Trevoke [?\]: It starts in 4-5 minutes
Tictactoe [-\]: this opening-interview was enlightening on the alphaGo internal process
hemster [-\]: how many games it took you to go 2k to 2d on kgs hongsuu
GoRoGoRo [7k?\]: good morning from Germany (5am)
Tictactoe [-\]: at least 1.ooo hemster
hongsuu: ok, thx trevoke :)
wry [3d\]: for people looking for a more technical comment than the officiel stream: https://www.youtube.com/c/usgoweb/live (starts later though)
gaia001 [5k\]: :D
hemster [-\]: I think it's bull to go 2k to 2d in 5 days
hongsuu: hemster, i was already betwen 1k and 1d, i took a pause, changed my style to alphago style of making slow groups and focussing in potential of fuseki
GoIngo [?\]: Good morning, everybody!
hongsuu: this worked perfectly
wry [3d\]: kgs ranking is bull though
hongsuu: how its bull if i won 7 games against random 2dans?
hongsuu: in 7 games instead
hongsuu: i will log in
Tictactoe [-\]: kgs ranking is incomparable to other rankingsystems
ithisa [25k\]: I like the Google stream music. I wonder where is it from?
lmox: Google music stream is another DeepMind project
rsun [-\]: improvised by alphago
Trevoke [?\]: This is how bored we are? We're talking about ranking systems? There are bigger things happening in history this week.
yoyoma [3d\]: yeah I want the AlphaGo soundtrack!
lmox: an AI that creates music soundtracks.
Randomanon [17k\]: Why am I firmly of the same ranking on kgs and igs then?
hongsuu: no way, already make a huge difference just with alphago, studied it for 15hours watching every comment.....this alphago is revealing all chinese secrets
cuby [2k\]: is this the same tictactoe from waaaay long ago?
Randomanon [17k\]: If they were all over the place there should be a divergence
Tictactoe [-\]: yes cuby it is
rsun [-\]: let's enjoy alphago's brilliant fuseki
cuby [2k\]: who used to play 9x9 games constantly?
cuby [2k\]: lol awesome
Watching: I'm really loving watching AlphaGo.
wry [3d\]: it's not alphago soundtrack, it's alpha no go soundtrack (http://imgur.com/a/WefEN)
Meloe [-\]: i can't bear this music anymore
hemster [-\]: please NO ONE cheer the ROBOT PLEASE
hongsuu: i agree with rsun.... alphago is just the sai we never had
Watching: It makes moves I think I'd make but I'd never be able to fully read the plays
hongsuu: go alphago!! show more brilliant fuseki! :DD
Tictactoe [-\]: you are mistaken tetris played the 9x9 
cuby [2k\]: riiiight right right
ithisa [25k\]: ROBOTS! GO ROBOTS! ARR OH BEE OH TEE ESS!
Eternal6k [4k\]: Let's go Lee!!!
rsun [-\]: aja looking as cool as ever
abxy: I want see KeJie vs Alphago
Randomanon [17k\]: 20 seconds
hemster [-\]: google lied to Lee Sedol on alphaGo strengh.  come on you know this
cuby [2k\]: hmm why does alphago play under british flag?
hongsuu: ajahuang is a boss
ithisa [25k\]: Aja must feel like Hikaru
Randomanon [17k\]: or so
]
;B[pd]C[Trevoke [?\]: abxy : I don't think any pro can beat AlphaGo, honestly.
jellyroll: w considers resign
LongLost [7k\]: DeepMind is a British company. Now owned by Google.
tig3rshark [19k\]: ha
cuby [2k\]: whoa cool 
abxy: just for entertainment
BongoBob [-\]: Tevoke, I kinda disagree. I think we just need to study alphago more..
hemster [-\]: its obvious.  but google was like hmm we don't know if it can beat pro??
jellyroll: clearly B leads.
Naphthalin [10k?\]: i thought by now b knew: "the winning move is not to play"
wry [3d\]: not sure any pro can, but would be interesting to see it playing against completely different play styles
hongsuu: alpha 4-4, game solved
Randomanon [17k\]: oh my stream is running late
ruby [2d\]: b wins
hongsuu: hehhe
Deterra [11k?\]: He's taking a while to respond to a 4-4
]
(;W[dp]C[abxy: once Q16 is played, b already won.
tig3rshark [19k\]: boo no cross game
ruby [2d\]: Lee trying Mirror go
Trevoke [?\]: BongoBob: I think AlphaGo is ... Relatively... Close to having "solved" Go. Our hint is that it plays "slack" or "slow" moves when it wants to guarantee a higher chance of victory, which means it think it has found a safe path to success.
ithisa [25k\]: That does't mean that it has solved go though.
Trevoke [?\]: No, not quite
hongsuu: man if lee sedol plays mirror go i will laugh
Watching: I disagree on Go being solved.  Solved means something specific.
Azal [2d\]: trevoke.. quite far away to have "solved" go
LongLost [7k\]: "It was Lee Sedol that lost the game, not a human (sic -- humanity)" -- last night's press conference translation.
heliox47 [13k?\]: mais a quoi pense alphago.............????
Trevoke [?\]: But we should see how early in the game AlphaGo plays "slack" moves.
hongsuu: how about the ladder mirror go game?
hongsuu: i remember ^^
ithisa [25k\]: Perhaps lee sedol just sucks compared to perfect play. And alphago sucks less
pulsar [?\]: even deepmind say that alphago can be improved a lot
]
;B[cd]C[Randomanon [17k\]: LongLost, that was what lee sedol said right?
rsun [-\]: again chinese opening
bryamatt [11k\]: looks like alpha is setting up another chinese
hongsuu: this opening
Codexus [7k?\]: Good morning!
hongsuu: play fast J17!!!
oonicks: same as yesterday
Eternal6k [4k\]: Alpha likes this opening
LongLost [7k\]: Rand: Yes.. he was personally taking responsibility for the loss.
hongsuu: the key is to ruin every fuseki tenuking everything
tig3rshark [19k\]: I would also like j17
]
;W[qp]C[Cyphase [?\]: solved means alphago could beat god
matiej [8k\]: mirrior go here we come!
hongsuu: mirrorgo?!
Trevoke [?\]: I was watching the game 2 15-minute summary and I think Redmond was watching the game on his phone or tablet on KGS
gooooo [-\]: the host...
Watching: I really hope that he doesn't take it personally, he doesn't deserve that judgement.
wry [3d\]: current alphago will be destroyed by future alphago in a couple years (and other AI), there's still a lot of room for improvement (same thing happened in chess)
pookpooiab: I love how Aja Huang place the stone with accuracy
bert [?\]: lol
rsun [-\]: p4 again?
bryamatt [11k\]: alpha go is gonna attack, then tenuki when she shouldn't and j17
hongsuu: mirrorgo, the ultimate strategy 
Casanova [3d\]: mirror go would be great.. to see what alphago does
iceweasel [-\]: the black stones look rather off-center
lmox: Yes, AlphaGo is Sai.
LongLost [7k\]: Lee Sedol's comments during the press conference have been nobly humble -- breathtaking earnest humility.
Trevoke [?\]: If Lee uses this game for mirror go, I'd be entertained.
Casanova [3d\]: go lee.. go lee.. kick  alphago ass at least once :)
wry [3d\]: mirror would be better as black starting at k10 though
pookpooiab: this will be fun!
Naphthalin [10k?\]: nice call rsun
indogo [11k?\]: human play go not because we want to win, but also  because we want to seek an answer we haven't found. While alphago maybe has found some of our question, so he play calmly
]
;B[op]
;W[oq]C[hongsuu: no more mirrorgo
pookpooiab: but other program already has anti mirror go strategy, don't know about alphago
adoreme [3d\]: who will do the agao commentary today?
Azal [2d\]: same as the second game so far
BongoBob [-\]: until we figure out what part of that answer that he has found
tig3rshark [19k\]: who said, "we have cars that go faster than humans but we still hold marathons?"
wry [3d\]: same as yesterday azal
pookpooiab: michael redmond
wry [3d\]: oops, was adoreme not azal
tig3rshark [19k\]: thank you
Trevoke [?\]: Wow. It would be amazing if he tried to replay the same game, in part to see if AlphaGo refollows the same path... And to see if he can improve on a move where he knows he made a mistake
pookpooiab: he already done that
Le0na99 [4k\]: Match LSD - AlphaGO?
]
;B[nq]
;W[pq]C[Falcon89 [5k\]: ya
BongoBob [-\]: yes
Le0na99 [4k\]: thx
rsun [-\]: n4 again?
superpal1 [1d\]: looks normal till now
cjb: replay of game 2 so far
Tictactoe [-\]: Sedol being white (for mobile viewers)
GoRoGoRo [7k?\]: next move exciting
superpal1 [1d\]: joseki
pookpooiab: game 1 and 2, he replay it with his friends
cjb: c6 next, in game 2
Casanova [3d\]: it would be great if LSD wins at least one game
fluidistic [-\]: the bot is not 100% predictable
superpal1 [1d\]: u cannot go wrong with joseki early game
wry [3d\]: really?
hongsuu: n4 is my new strategy followed by tenuki and peep q5
hongsuu: rofl
matiej [8k\]: well, who knows maybe not all josekis are really optimal, :)
ruby [2d\]: lol 
]
;B[cn]C[thomas [2k\]: Proverbs should be categorized as pre-AlphaGo and post-AlphaGo.
Syptryn [2d\]: At least sedol is saving on time!
Watching: Hm.
rsun [-\]: lee sedol has advantage in time
bryamatt [11k\]: if alpha does tigermouth here is it same opening as game 2?
]
;W[fq]C[iskatel [3k\]: ;))
hongsuu: hahahah
iskatel [3k\]: n4 
hongsuu: he is playing the same
Azal [2d\]: yeah
Watching: Lee Sedol is playing an identical game of Game 2?
ruby [2d\]: lee playing very fast
indogo [11k?\]: wow, this is interesting
cjb: remarkable
Watching: Amazing.
BongoBob [-\]: first time advantage lee sedol has had?
Tictactoe [-\]: yes identital to game two indeed
hongsuu: so q5 is the new joseki
hanniibal [6k\]: Youtube for see
murky [?\]: one version of ayabot follows exactly the same moves as previous game
hongsuu: thanks alphago for such a new moves :D
superpal1 [1d\]: w got 2 corners now
superpal1 [1d\]: good job sedol
ThiGar [4k\]: They both play fast!!
rsun [-\]: if n4, w pincer k4
hongsuu: i doubt if w change
]
;B[mp]C[rsun [-\]: here we go
murky [?\]: if you win one game will can win all the rest games
superpal1 [1d\]: r6
hongsuu: will w change?
Anatoly [2d?\]: lol
indogo [11k?\]: r6:)
Jermelle [?\]: Same opening as last time
geek [?\]: haha
Watching: This is pretty interesting.
ruby [2d\]: Is AlphaGo deterministic?
lmox: rsun may not be 9d, but he is 9d in robot psychology.
iskatel [3k\]: r6 j17 ?
bryamatt [11k\]: n10? i think it was around there in game 2
Trevoke [?\]: So far it might be
Bovido [6k\]: No, ruby.
fluidistic [-\]: no ruby
lmox: I don't think so, ruby.
bryamatt [11k\]: d10**
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol saves time by replaying his game
ruby [2d\]: ok 
hongsuu: r6 please
Syptryn [2d\]: I would just save time if I was sedol
Watching: Unlikely deterministic, but the policy network might push this to be obviously-common moves.
rsun [-\]: lee sedol deciding between d10 and k4
murky [?\]: so alphago maybe the same nonsense program
wry [3d\]: superpal1: Oohashi Hirofumi comment about the first 2 games: "Dammit I can't sleep. After analyzing it I think Lee lost the first match on the 7th move and the second match on the 14th move. I can't be 100% sure but that's the conclusion of my analysis. Is this for real?" (can't go wrong in fuseki? :p)
superpal1 [1d\]: will he do a m3 first before going for r6
hongsuu: what if white play r6 and alphago plays the same?
Trevoke [?\]: It's not quite supposed to be deterministic, but... Same input has led to same output.
fluidistic [-\]: someone should have told LSD that mirrorgo works against alphago and that a 30k noob would have won due to that
rsun [-\]: oh wait
ithisa [25k\]: Trevoke: it's not deterministic but it isn't RandomBot either
pookpooiab: it's not mirror go
rsun [-\]: w r6 first, my bad
ThiGar [4k\]: for sure Lee knows exactly when he will diverge
hongsuu: i know what w is trying to do, he will play insane weirdo game to test all b failures, and win in the 5th game
ithisa [25k\]: it will play nondeterministically in miai and similar situations
hongsuu: :D lee sedol you are the best! :D
Azal [2d\]: q5
indogo [11k?\]: if alphago hasn't learn anything he maybe wil play the same moves
hongsuu: who knows
edlee [1k\]: ruby, it's not deterministic on purpose -- DM would not want the human to find any deterministic line :)
Watching: Has Lee Sedol played an aggressive invasion of AlphaGo's space?
Syptryn [2d\]: Alphago learns very little from a single game
geek [?\]: It coulds be really fun if they play exactly the same moves until like move 50 where Lee Sedol corrects a mistake
Azal [2d\]: yeah my move xD
]
;W[po]C[Eternal6k [4k\]: Divergence
Bovido [6k\]: AlphaGo is frozen right now.
ruby [2d\]: hmm
hongsuu: oh nooooooo
BongoBob [-\]: wha
Syptryn [2d\]: NOOOOOO!!!!
pookpooiab: but the moment lee sedol play something different alphago will respond different too
rsun [-\]: q5 took away b's q5 lol
indogo [11k?\]: it's now :D
ruby [2d\]: AlphaGo laughing
ThiGar [4k\]: Lee Sedol won again the Korean championship just recently.
Randomanon [17k\]: old school
Syptryn [2d\]: if I was sedol, I'd repeat till my abvious mistake 
Watching: I don't understand, is this a good move?
lmox: AlphaGo is now crashing.
cjb: it's joseki
hongsuu: alphago sir.. what you play now???? 
Trevoke [?\]: This is an interesting change.
lmox: Watching - it is a normal continuation
bryamatt [11k\]: 11 moves it was identical to game 2
Eternal6k [4k\]: That's where b plays later
Watching: I feel like B to a larger, more aggressive space.
rsun [-\]: q5 puts more pressure on n4 group
]
;B[iq]C[Mars [11k\]: makes sense, rsun.
Randomanon [17k\]: lee wants to see what alphago will do in response
drueknmstr [3d\]: yeah bryanmatt very surprising
asdfa: peep
hongsuu: and now b plays normal
rsun [-\]: now w e16 or pincer
indogo [11k?\]: this game means that's LSD want to take alphago home and study it
danielhast [4k\]: *now* AlphaGo doesn't think tenuki is good anymore
cjb: the move just played was tenukid in game 2
cekalo [1k\]: q5 is strange move
cjb: so this seems like a win 
yoyoma [3d\]: mind games!
geek [?\]: haha
adoreme [3d\]: Alphago takes pity and plays 2 stones weaker than yesterday
BongoBob [-\]: Does alphago dream of tenuki peeps?
geek [?\]: NOW you don't tenuki, aha !
hongsuu: b looks better
GoIngo [?\]: opinion by crazy stone after move 12: 48 % for black
Buddy514 [5k?\]: q5 is joseki
luxfiam [?\]: bongobob i see what you did there
ithisa [25k\]: Haha crazy stone
Bazzi [1d\]: Wetern technology has ruined kid's hope.
Syptryn [2d\]: yay, whtie is winning
BongoBob [-\]: ;)
hongsuu: golngo. crazystone!?
fluidistic [-\]: several programmers of alphago are asian
matiej [8k\]: guys predicting the outcome after 13 moves doesnt provide much information, unless some blunder has beed played
indogo [11k?\]: I bet LSD will also play undo if he has AG on his laptop :D
profan [-\]: i expect a novelty now
Watching: So Redmond is talking about the middle-right invasion, and that's what I'd imagine Black would do but I guess AlphaGo prioritorizes removing White's possible territory?
HDT [?\]: Game 1: Normal, Game 2: Hard, Game 3: Very Hard, Game 4: Undefeated, Game 5: Can't Play
fluidistic [-\]: matthew lai, aja huang are both asians and programmers of alphago
rsun [-\]: novelty will come from b only
wry [3d\]: Alphago hasn't learned anything from previous games, Lee is playing against the exact same version as previous game (AI is not deteministic)
icecream99 [1d?\]: I wanted white to extend on the lower side to cramp b's three stones
Watching: Will White move into the mididle-right?
profan [-\]: somehing like k4 ^^
MrM [3k\]: what is the youtube channel?
Tictactoe [-\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw
rsun [-\]: the most open area is top left
MrM [3k\]: thanks
drueknmstr [3d\]: lee going to end in time pressure again
Trevoke [?\]: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw
hongsuu: w must J17
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone is french go bot
Long [?\]: is the aga stream will have cho hyeyeon again
wry [3d\]: B+105.5, SE knows, praise SE o/
Trevoke [?\]: I prefer gaming: it's a dark-themed website, easier on the eyes
cjb: don't think  so, Long
rsun [-\]: e16 has highest probability
bryamatt [11k\]: that's the scary part wry! although I question if she has anything left to learn.... or how far past humans she is
fluidistic [-\]: btw 1st time i see Lee Sedol on kgs.  hope he plays more often
rsun [-\]: or e17
rsun [-\]: some kind of kakari
Randomanon [17k\]: icecream, wouldn't that just give alphago room to run to the centre
Long [?\]: cho hyeyeon was great yesterday
drueknmstr [3d\]: yeah i think se must be right
lmox: yeah, hopefully Lee plays more on KGS.
Lasagne [4k\]: lol
Mars [11k\]: When was AlphaGo first started?
Eternal6k [4k\]: Lol
hongsuu: quite interesting redmond 
icecream99 [1d?\]: Sure. You can't have everything. But hopefully w would be more efficient
lmox: There is the possibility that AlphaGo will play on KGS for reals though
rsun [-\]: within 2 years
BongoBob [-\]: not sure, but I think 2 years?
Syptryn [2d\]: I'd like to see KGS 14D 
Syptryn [2d\]: for alphago
highhand [5k\]: w j5?
braincrash [?\]: doubt it
Long [?\]: alphago will correct and standardize rankiing
oonicks: i have seen play like r11 and liked that
rsun [-\]: w can also r14
Tictactoe [-\]: f16?
oonicks: but i think it is very hard
Mars [11k\]: Lee taking tons of time in beginning
]
;W[ec]C[pookpooiab: if alphago win 4-1 it's 12D, if it's 5-0 then more game need to be play to find its upper bound
hongsuu: we must make a test, don't let a top pro play more games, and never watch alphago. Later put another top pro who played alphago for 10 years. I guess humans will get 12p
Azal [2d\]: what says cs?
Winrry [9k?\]: its lee style
ThiGar [4k\]: Who is Chris Garlock (commenting with Michael Redmond)?
Winrry [9k?\]: he always uses more time at beginning
rsun [-\]: aga e-journal
ruby [2d\]: KOSUMI!
heliox47 [13k?\]: guys, who is this crazystone ? 
Trevoke [?\]: Chris Garlock is editor of the AGA E-Journal, a 3d amateur
ThiGar [4k\]: thx rsun
Watching: Crazystone is a program, no?
cekalo [1k\]: Garlock is cool
bryamatt [11k\]: these games should have more than 2 hours. alpha gets a huge advantage for so little time
hongsuu: ok, if b kosumi sai exists
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone is french go bot
BongoBob [-\]: crazystone is a french monte-carlo roboto
HDT [?\]: FUJIWARANO SAI
Watching: http://www.remi-coulom.fr/CrazyStone/
GoIngo [?\]: 6-dan on kgs
heliox47 [13k?\]: ty
wry [3d\]: would love to see a pro accepting to play alphago with handicap
GoIngo [?\]: I am running it in analysis mode during this game
rsun [-\]: alpha will pincer
Long [?\]: this event is strikingly very similar to hikaru no go
drueknmstr [3d\]: at least to take handi after 3 losses
Tictactoe [-\]: yes good info golngo
Watching: Huuuuh...
]
;B[hd]C[zampa [-\]: yes!  push alphago let lee sedol get 2h handicap last game.
Mars [11k\]: j16 played
indogo [11k?\]: @Golngo: using what program?
wry [3d\]: yeah something like, play games starting at no handicap and add 1 for every loss
GoIngo [?\]: from time to time I give crazy stone evaluations
wry [3d\]: could be interesting
hongsuu: hm, what if top pro loses with 9 handicap?
hongsuu: .....?!
rsun [-\]: w can counter pincer
cjb: d14 good?
Naphthalin [10k?\]: anyone watches ke jie and can share his thoughts?
wry [3d\]: then we'll know that we know nothing about go :p
rsun [-\]: on the left side
Tictactoe [-\]: won't happen honsuu
hongsuu: are u sure? :)
lmox: the dangerous and devastating pincer movement
GoIngo [?\]: programmer of Crazy Stone is Remi Coulom the fathr of Monte Carlo tree search
Tictactoe [-\]: yes
GoIngo [?\]: father
ThiGar [4k\]: nobody knows yet what the true handicap is between AlphaGo and top pros, 2, 3 stones?
cjb: perhaps not that much
pipu [5d\]: i guess for now just no komi
cjb: fan hui won a few informal games
cjb: but like you say, we don't know
pipu [5d\]: need to wait for it to lose :p
zampa [-\]: alphago is much stronger now compared to then.
rsun [-\]: if w d15, b push cut
Watching: I think it would be really really cool if AlphaGo reorients the rules to White Komi.
drueknmstr [3d\]: seems like its been winning by more than komi every game right?
Syptryn [2d\]: c13 
ruby [2d\]: G15
hongsuu: omg, redmond comments are awesome
pipu [5d\]: the first game was 2.5
cjb: drueknmstr: and it plays slack when ahead, too
pookpooiab: win rate from either zen of crazy stone please ;)
Syptryn [2d\]: I think lee should save more time for mid game
cjb: so we can't really take score as meaningful
zampa [-\]: alphago doesn't care if its just 0.5p win.
pipu [5d\]: but we can't say anything by that cos it only wnts to win 0.5 so doesnt play optimally
Eternal6k [4k\]: W played
cjb: right
wry [3d\]: Remy is not really father of MCTS, but father of using it successfully in go AI
GoIngo [?\]: cs: 50 % after move 15
bryamatt [11k\]: yeah... only time alpha plays 'bad' is when it's ahead.... and makes it slightly more likely to win by atleast .5
hongsuu: how do u see cs winrate?
GoIngo [?\]: wrong wry
GoIngo [?\]: read remi thesis from 2005
Tictactoe [-\]: yes mc existed remi used it in go
Azal [2d\]: goingo
Eternal6k [4k\]: D15
pipu [5d\]: will google release alpha's win rate evaluations?
LongLost [7k\]: When Richmond talks about AlphaGo's possibility, his youthful enthusiasm brightens up.
Syptryn [2d\]: Where go can access CS win rate?
Azal [2d\]: before move 15 how was the rate?
rsun [-\]: you can buy a copy
gogonuts [4d\]: you have to run it
GoIngo [?\]: I have cs running on my computer
djo666 [3k\]: lien youtub svp
trippin [3k\]: how many turns unti Lee makes first big mistake that alphago punishes? Last game it happened on move 31
fluidistic [-\]: e15 
ThiGar [4k\]: remi teaches at Lille University (north of France)
fluidistic [-\]: for w
hongsuu: what, you run cs on your computer?
GoIngo [?\]: you can buy crazy stone in shop
pookpooiab: anyone has zen here>?
fluidistic [-\]: no remi doesn't teach anymore
drueknmstr [3d\]: LongLost some of the best bits of this whole alphago thing is watching people's reactions to it, including lee sedol 
hongsuu: it works in pentium 4?
python1111: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWGHm2RwMes  >> game without review
Eternal6k [4k\]: Ah
Watching: (Oh, I thought it was move 29 last night)
GoIngo [?\]: remi was chess programmer around 2000
Watching: (I didn't know that folks thought it was move 31
GoIngo [?\]: switched to go then
Trevoke [?\]: What's the link to the pure stream of the game?
fluidistic [-\]: remi works in hiw own compagny, he isn't a professor anymore
Trevoke [?\]: Not DeepMind, not AGA
Tictactoe [-\]: commercial cs wins over commercial zen most of the time
rustychow [5k\]: how strong is Chris Garlock?
bryamatt [11k\]: he's halfway to breaking that streak trippin
Trevoke [?\]: 3d amateur
Tictactoe [-\]: chris = 3d
gogonuts [4d\]: garlock 9p at small talk
GoIngo [?\]: I think commercial zen and commercial crazy sstone are on par
BongoBob [-\]: Trevoke, python1111 just linked it
LongLost [7k\]: Amazing is the greater admiration for AlphaGo from the people who didn't make it. That's a revelation.
gooooo [-\]: I wish Chris was muteable
rustychow [5k\]: so garlock is pretending
hongsuu: so now its possible to run cs in normal computer?
Tictactoe [-\]: good morning nuts ^^
Trevoke [?\]: wow, thanks. Totally missed it.
gogonuts [4d\]: morning :-)
GoIngo [?\]: yes, 70 $
ruby [2d\]: Chris "how long is a millisecond"
hongsuu: omg, im gonna buy
GoIngo [?\]: for license
]
;W[cg]C[hongsuu: thx golngo
GoIngo [?\]: zen is similar in price
drueknmstr [3d\]: ah geez
cjb: is this joseki?
geek [?\]: and... Chris Garlock talking about his dad
rsun [-\]: e16 most likely for humans
LongLost [7k\]: Oooh -- complicated joseki.
gogonuts [4d\]: lol, goooo
Syptryn [2d\]: Holy shit
Syptryn [2d\]: I played LSD move
ThiGar [4k\]: Chris Garlock appears very humble in his commentaries
drueknmstr [3d\]: now i feel worried for lee
hongsuu: and why gghideki runs it on xeon servers?
braincrash [?\]: lee pulling out the stops
Eternal6k [4k\]: Wow nice
fluidistic [-\]: lee playing 2d moves.  good
GoIngo [?\]: gghideki is co-father of zen
rustychow [5k\]: Chris Garlock is the ultimate sandbagger
trippin [3k\]: 2d move?
Lasagne [4k\]: there's a weird social connection between these commentators. but it seems they got used to each other more this game :)
LATE [1k\]: more like 1k
Tictactoe [-\]: hideki is using his uni-hardware
iambad [2d?\]: hi... any youtube live stream
Jirvo [?\]: this the alphago vs lee match?
rsun [-\]: wow syp got banned instantaneously
pookpooiab: crazystone has 2015 version, available in japanese language
Jirvo [?\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw
GoIngo [?\]: hideki is working on his ph.d. thesis
Azal [2d\]: cs rate?
drueknmstr [3d\]: agree Lasagne
Eternal6k [4k\]: B d15,wc10?
Watching: Whaaat
]
;B[ed]C[hongsuu: wait, but the difference in cs on xeon versus normal computer is just the time of reading moves?
oonicks: i am curious ago has an opinion on that situation now
GoIngo [?\]: I "only" have western 2013 version of cs
oonicks: ah
geek [?\]: WHY is everyone talking about crazystone and not alphago ?
lmox: good question, geek
pipu [6d\]: cos we dont know anything bout alpha :p
asdfa: D16
nostalgia [4d\]: can we freely talk aboutLSD in this room?
pookpooiab: yeah I don't think it'll be many difference between 2013 and 2015 version
Watching: Crazystone is what we can access, and what folks classically played against.
hongsuu: cos alpha is impossible to buy now.. and for 70$ is possible
trippin [3k\]: there will be an AGA stream tonight right?
iambad [2d?\]: thx
GoIngo [?\]: we will switch to alphago soon
hongsuu: :-D
Trevoke [?\]: trippin: yes
drueknmstr [3d\]: i think the winrate being posted is from cs geek
Trevoke [?\]: It will start in 30 minutes, I think.
Syptryn [2d\]: d16 
pookpooiab: by the way google classified alphago as 5p
Jirvo [?\]: we wont be able to beat alpha go
Jirvo [?\]: and if we do
rsun [-\]: lee so far so good
hongsuu: this is the best 5p in earth life, promoted to 9p soon
Jirvo [?\]: it will learn
bryamatt [11k\]: alpha go is 10p
trippin [3k\]: I was planning to go to bed early tonight, I've stayed up until 3am for all of the first 3 games, but I couldnt help myself haha
BongoBob [-\]: wonder how well LSD does against alphago in private matches..
BongoBob [-\]: without the human pressure
oonicks: he wins a lot of chamionships
lmox: I am hoping to see AlphaGo on KGS soon.
hongsuu: its weird, but looks like michael redmond is better than lee sedol
hongsuu: lol :D
BongoBob [-\]: yes, but this has become a worldwide event.
lmox: A developer said it might be possible.
zampa [-\]: trippin i'm up untill 9am to see the games.
Watching: Lack of stress I think does a lot for it.
Tictactoe [-\]: Andrew is enjoying his broadcasts, so i guess he won't miss the opportunity
Buddy514 [5k?\]: There are some people who are trying to develop an AlphaGo like program based on the Nature program.
Buddy514 [5k?\]: Paper
trippin [3k\]: =) I'm impressed with your dedication zampa
lmox: Andrew is the best broadcaster
fluidistic [-\]: alphago on kgs?  I stop my life, job and all that stuff to get glued on kgs
Cyphase [?\]: it would also be interesting to see how well he'd do against the current version over time, as he plays it more
GoIngo [?\]: several people try to reach alpha go level with their bots
]
;W[cj]C[Watching: I wonder what AlphaGo will handle a speed game.
Falcon89 [5k\]: noooo fluid, you don't do that
Syptryn [2d\]: weird
LongLost [7k\]: Andrew is the Conan O'Brien of MCing.
oonicks: i have my thoughts here.. but i am so rusty oh it helps
Syptryn [2d\]: isn't this locally very bad for white top left?
Watching: Is there lag on the stream, or is it just me?
Winrry [9k?\]: hi falcon :p
GoIngo [?\]: come to Leiden (NL) in July
pookpooiab: darkforest also analysis the first two game and alphago seems to be lead even in the opening sequence
murky [?\]: w playing fast developing game
gooooo [-\]: so a 3d doesn't know about sacrificing stones
GoIngo [?\]: to the computer olympiad
hongsuu: white position is better, wait for another weirdo SAI move from alpha
UTDEspy [-\]: The stream is lagging, Wastching
]
;B[dc]C[hongsuu: do F5 over it and work
Jirvo [?\]: its fine for me
fluidistic [-\]: pookpooiab where did you see that analysis?
Watching: OK TY for the response. <3
oonicks: alpha agrees my thought tho
gaia001 [5k\]: c5 
ThiGar [4k\]: Redmond looks much younger than 52
Watching: Also, so it's faster here in this room over the stream?
pookpooiab: in ttian yuandong website
Tictactoe [-\]: reload in case of lag, there are over twenty thousand viewers
Ph1xi3 [-\]: I don't lag at all. This demonstration is about... 5-10s delay
Lasagne [4k\]: it's funny how often michael doesn't let chris finish his sentence. but it's also understable because he gets to the point so slowly :)
fluidistic [-\]: link please pook?
Cyphase [?\]: if you're watching on youtube, you can speed up the stream to catch up
Mars [11k\]: game without commentary?
LongLost [7k\]: Living in Japan extends your lifespan, evidently.
Syptryn [2d\]: Serious, redmond is 52? Playing go clearly makes you mmortal
BongoBob [-\]: Mars: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWGHm2RwMes
pookpooiab: http://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/yuandong/20639694
Jirvo [?\]: is alpha go in this? or is it someone hosting it and coping the moves?
hongsuu: in other hand, looks like alpha go is some chinese pro team saying nice moves and inserting into screen
hongsuu: so human
fluidistic [-\]: thanks a lot pookpooiab
Mars [11k\]: thanks, bongobob.
pipu [6d\]: japanese diet helps retain youthfulness? :)
hongsuu: sedol b4
hongsuu: wow
]
;W[bp]C[hongsuu: w will m3 seems
Winrry [9k?\]: black very solid
Syptryn [2d\]: huh
asdfa: michael redmond played this joseki in the top left in a match in 1984 against Jimmy Cha
nostalgia [4d\]: it's normal
Syptryn [2d\]: why is white playing so soft?
gogonuts [4d\]: b4 seems defeatist to me
Watching: @Jirvo Tictactoe is a saint and is playing the moves for us.
Syptryn [2d\]: Shouldn't c5 be better? to make black heavy?
gohand2 [1d\]: b gonna win again
oonicks: jump is normal
Watching: B4 does seem very soft.  Hm.
gohand2 [1d\]: that top left corner is biggg
lmox: hmm I like b4
Archimed [4k\]: maybe C3 is too severe
hongsuu: b4 is questionable
bruh [4d\]: b4 is not soft; it was even first suggested by pro in Korean stream before C5
lmox: yeah, b4 looks reasonable
pipu [6d\]: b4 is common when b has j3
lmox: removes a lot of bad aji
gogonuts [4d\]: now b can take the right without pain
fanweiqi [9d\]: so far so good
Rexxar [1k\]: lee doesnt want to get rekt so early again
gohand2 [1d\]: i like C5
fanweiqi [9d\]: so it seems
Tictactoe [-\]: b4 is the first stone on the second line, so it could be percieved as submissive
Watching: I think LSD wants to connect his two group and later invade/reduce topleft...?
Azal [2d\]: mmmmm
Syptryn [2d\]: now right is so big
rsun [-\]: r10 now
gogonuts [4d\]: redmond too generous here, imo
hongsuu: o17...
Syptryn [2d\]: and white has not time to play it...
Azal [2d\]: lsd must attack c6 now
GoRoGoRo [7k?\]: Tictactoe may be a saint. At least he is a friend.
Azal [2d\]: whats says cs?
K5 [5k?\]: Maybe LSD is making a conscious effort to try moves that lead to novel positions
Cam [2k\]: r10 reasonable
Trevoke [?\]: B o17 
Syptryn [2d\]: It feels like LSD has lost fighting spirit... like what happens if I was playing a Pro
Cam [2k\]: b4 is normal in this position
pipu [6d\]: this type of opening with no complicated joseki is maybe a good idea vs alpha, problem is lee sedol also sucks at this type of game
K5 [5k?\]: M17?
pipu [6d\]: puts more emphasis on evaluating which is the biggest move
Jirvo [?\]: alpha played 
BongoBob [-\]: wow.. o17 instead of right side?
PuppyPants [6k\]: b017
rsun [-\]: looks like this game can last till endgame
Cam [2k\]: we wont be seeing m17
Watching: (I feel like White looks better in his start than the other games I've watched)
trippin [3k\]: I wonder if Lee feels less pressure today
ghgfh: +pipu
gohand2 [1d\]: thats y kejie or guli should play against alpahgo
trippin [3k\]: There is no expectation to win
kdbaby14 [6k\]: B already played O-17
K5 [5k?\]: ^N17
fanweiqi [9d\]: so far
fanweiqi [9d\]: so good
fanweiqi [9d\]: so it seems
thomas [2k\]: I would think he would. I hope it leads him to more creative play.
Jermelle [?\]: Ke Jie would rek alpha go
bromeas [1k?\]: https://gomameguru.com/alphago-4/
]
;B[nc]C[Cam [2k\]: doesnt n17 invite white to take the right side?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: W Q-10
bromeas [1k?\]: commemts by redmond
hongsuu: the reverse of it cam
fluidistic [-\]: well north is now black
Syptryn [2d\]: Alphago has covnerted from Japanese to Korea
BongoBob [-\]: but gives b strenght in attacking right side as well
indogo [11k?\]: lee has found some of his question maybe and play calm :)
Watching: That's what I'm thinking...
Trevoke [?\]: W r11 
jellyroll: w should not allowu upper side... once again B making  BIG framework...  break it up!
Bazzi [1d\]: alphago winning now.
K5 [5k?\]: top looks more potential than RHS
superpal1 [1d\]: this is the type of game i want to watch
Long [?\]: wow
Syptryn [2d\]: Lee Seedol has converetd from Korean to Japanese style :D
Watching: This looks kind of super-nice. :D
gogonuts [4d\]: wow, o17
superpal1 [1d\]: unlike the first 3 matches
Cam [2k\]: Yeah I like how the top still is going to be a moyo lol..
gohand2 [1d\]: japanese style not good fro lsd
lmox: to me, o17 would seem a bit slow
lmox: but clearly I'm wrong :)
ruby [2d\]: !!!
hongsuu: omg.... e4
Syptryn [2d\]: Redmond made mistake, 
Watching: R10
gohand2 [1d\]: but o17 is solid
hongsuu: unusual again
Trevoke [?\]: W r11 and B e4
fluidistic [-\]: 2 moves played already
pookpooiab: I think alphago in october is already strong enough, but Lee Sedol seems overconfident so DeepMind work days and nights on this
hongsuu: hhahhahaha, sai is playing
BongoBob [-\]: wah
fluidistic [-\]: thie relay is 2 moves behind
gogonuts [4d\]: q10 is pretty nice for w
]
;W[qi]C[Bazzi [1d\]: japanese style is the origin of all go style.
]
;B[ep]C[GoRoGoRo [7k?\]: AlphaGo remembers the nice upper side in the last game. Wants it again
Isla [?\]: ...
hongsuu: this move....
Cam [2k\]: wtf alphago lool
Tictactoe [-\]: yes r11, had to make sure
gogonuts [4d\]: b already consolidating? ;-)
Str1fe [4d\]: alphago BM!
K5 [5k?\]: ladder connection?
Jermelle [?\]: Going hard.
bruh [4d\]: oh man, E4 made Lee Sedol go full DansGame
fluidistic [-\]: b won
Syptryn [2d\]: Alphago thinks he so ahead that he playing victory moves already
Winrry [9k?\]: e4 looks so crude
Azal [2d\]: e5
hongsuu: man if e4 win, i believe this bot could give 9hc to pro
ruby [2d\]: Kami no itte
K5 [5k?\]: interesting probe
thomas [2k\]: It makes sense, it's the only place he's weak
Watching: If that E4 goes through, I'm amazed.
Bazzi [1d\]: That is a Takemiya Masaki move.
Syptryn [2d\]: e5 
rsun [-\]: e3 is satisfactory
lmox: e5
Winrry [9k?\]: japanese style?
pookpooiab: may we have winrate please ;)
Azal [2d\]: no, w can't allow e3
pookpooiab: from cs maybe?
Azal [2d\]: too soft
oonicks: e4 makes some use of c6 does not look impossible
Trevoke [?\]: What's the goal of e4? seems like it might want to swalloe f3
geek [?\]: Trevoke : please follow the live
gogonuts [4d\]: time to make breakfast(here in europe) 10 min for lee to answer
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone now gives 48 % for black
LEIBNIZ [2k\]: E4 hard to see, what is its purpose?
Trevoke [?\]: /s/lloe/llow
Azal [2d\]: yeah !!!!! 
geek [?\]: Redmond is explaining e4
Ph1xi3 [-\]: How long will it take for commentators to notice r10 is wrong.
Azal [2d\]: w finally ahead 
hongsuu: trevoke, a 9p is commenting in youtube live....in english language
fatih [1d\]: e4 is just trying to force white to defend at e4
Trevoke [?\]: geek: which live?
BongoBob [-\]: redmond needs to correct Q10 to Q9 on his board
fatih [1d\]: at e3
gogonuts [4d\]: ingo, don't give us false hopes :-)
zavion [2k\]: i really hope w is going to seperate with g5 at some point
mate105 [1d\]: At least w is ahead in CS prediction.
Trevoke [?\]: Oy, I apologize for trying to start a conversation.
Trevoke [?\]: I'll go back to just watching all the streams.
archron0 [4k\]: where can we find the link for live stream?
GoIngo [?\]: but 48 % is within 50 % area
BongoBob [-\]: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw for commentary
Winrry [9k?\]: try google
Trevoke [?\]: Deepming stream: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw
hongsuu: trevoke, here is free to add comments too
fanweiqi [9d\]: Oh MYYYY
nostalgia [4d\]: alphago is the evil of baduk
BongoBob [-\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWGHm2RwMes without commentary
fanweiqi [9d\]: alphago is definitely the angel
hongsuu: i'm gonna use this new moves
nostalgia [4d\]: he has no feeling
nostalgia [4d\]: even he can win any opponents
mate105 [1d\]: One victory for Lee is good enough for him to regain his confidence.
DonValley [6d?\]: fanweiqi vs alphago?
zavion [2k\]: e4 is not a new move according to redmond, but its early (again)
]
;W[eo]C[ghgfh: a beautiful move
fluidistic [-\]: se dol smoking too much time early
Azal [2d\]: yeah my move 
Azal [2d\]: gogogo
Syptryn [2d\]: Awesome, LSD plays like me again!
lmox: my move too
fanweiqi [9d\]: if i had Infinitely time
Syptryn [2d\]: YAY, LSD playing like 2ds!
fluidistic [-\]: told u se dol plays like a 2d
fanweiqi [9d\]: maybe 20 hours
lmox: I am 2d too
fanweiqi [9d\]: I think i can WIN
ghgfh: You plsy like Lee Sedol :D
Azal [2d\]: xD
Trevoke [?\]: Hey, there was an awesome guess-the-move website last night, is the owner here this time too?
fanweiqi [9d\]: at 3 stones
Azal [2d\]: maybe we are 9p guys..
nero [1k\]: this is the weakness of alphago
gogonuts [4d\]: fluid, that was a natural place to spend time
Eternal6k [4k\]: Nice not passive
hongsuu: what are they drinking?
rsun [-\]: black going to show off some myoshu soon
lamchan [1d\]: Book's move
Watching: I too am expecting that Black is after F3, no?
Azal [2d\]: this is intereseting... if cs thinks that b is a bid behind.. and AG maybe thinkgs the same... 
]
;B[dk]C[Azal [2d\]: there could be some irrational moves from AG 
Watching: Oh hey.  
gogonuts [4d\]: 99% chance coffee
rsun [-\]: here comes the myoshu sequence
mate105 [1d\]: Will there be AGA live commentary today?
zavion [2k\]: ohhhhh d9
Eternal6k [4k\]: AG ≠ cs
Sabbaticus [6k\]: What is myoshu?
BongoBob [-\]: myoshu?
hongsuu: isnt coffee considered doping?
gogonuts [4d\]: maybe redmond green tea :-)
LongLost [7k\]: d9.. awe.
pookpooiac: yes, we know ag is not cs, but it's what we have
Azal [2d\]: yep
bromeas [1k?\]: redmond live stream comments at  https://gomameguru.com/alphago-4/
gogonuts [4d\]: wow
weaknoob: AlphaGo's job is to ruin any plan you make and never let you have your way
aham [8k\]: f17
rsun [-\]: myoshu is the level below kami no itte but above the level of "good"
BongoBob [-\]: ah
lmox: myoshu is ghost move
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Isn't that a pretty wide range?
Long [?\]: alphago know how to probe
kali15 [4k\]: will myungwan do a stream today?
Syptryn [2d\]: woa
Watching: Does anyone remember their history?  Did White have a handicap once upon a time?
Sabbaticus [6k\]: I mean between the God move and "good' there is at least the level of "tesuji" and "sabaki"
funhouse [2k\]: myungwan in 20 min
LongLost [7k\]: The commentators all get caught up in their variations -- despite that the game has moved on. Understandable -- for humans.
hongsuu: r10 is annoying me
zampa [-\]: i liked the girl that commented yesterday.
josh858: is redmond stalling while he tries to figure out how to describe d9?
fanweiqi [9d\]: it is great that Alphago has shown us that
zampa [-\]: thought she did a great job with the commentary
gogonuts [4d\]: anybody have a link to ke jie commentary?
fanweiqi [9d\]: the number of viable openings
funhouse [2k\]: but it will be Cho Hyeyeon not myungwan
zavion [2k\]: d9 nice asking move
fanweiqi [9d\]: is Way more than we thought
Trevoke [?\]: Watching: a long time ago, Go games had a cross-opening on the star points, two black stones and two white stones. AFAIK when that was changed, B and W were considered even until komi was introduced
rsun [-\]: tesuji and sabaki don't really describe the level of "good"ness
gru [1k\]: d5
superpal1 [1d\]: e11'
gogonuts [4d\]: i don't understand a word of chinese, but ke's variations are the best
Azal [2d\]: lee needs to take his time in this move
Trevoke [?\]: Lee is sitting straight at the edge of his seat
indogo [11k?\]: d7
Rephos [23k\]: ./
Watching: TY
hongsuu: w is gonna win
papabearx3 [7k\]: how strong is the other guy with redmond
Tictactoe [-\]: redmond explains the word tewari
hongsuu: 1d i think
rsun [-\]: w needs to figure out what d9 has to do with e4
sindarus [14k?\]: 3d AGA
Tictactoe [-\]: chris garlock is 3d
hongsuu: ok thx
blacksea [?\]: 3d Amateur
bromeas [1k?\]: redmond suggest f4
gogonuts [4d\]: just take c9 - don't build a labyrinth in your own mind
papabearx3 [7k\]: cool
papabearx3 [7k\]: i love how excited he gets
Trevoke [?\]: The other guy with Redmond is 3d amateur, he is trying to make sure the commentary remains accessible to people who have never played Go before
pookpooiac: ke jie still think he's 60% against alphago after watching third game
kmm9288 [4k\]: does redmond have a misplayed stone at r10?
cekalo [1k\]: is there no aga go streaming?
Sabbaticus [6k\]: why c9 nd not D10?
bruh [4d\]: I think, before F4, W should get C9 in first
weaknoob: 15mins
Nick23 [1d\]: I really enjoy watching the official stream now. What improved faster, AlphaGo since October or the official stream since Game 1?
Azal [2d\]: c9 not good i think... b would go to make moyo again
GoIngo [?\]: ke jie is really smart
papabearx3 [7k\]: he does a great job. i think newbies would glaze over with redmonds commentary
Watching: Yes, Redmond has a misplaced stone but he's also not taylking about it.
Trevoke [?\]: MR. REDMOND! IT'S R11 !
rsun [-\]: redmond heard your question, sabbaticus
LongLost [7k\]: This commentary would be baffling if you hadn't played before.
kor: what is the link for ke jie?
Long [?\]: ke jie just wants some money 
Syptryn [2d\]: CS: Black wins with p = 50.4%
vasdvasdv [6k\]: I think f5 is the key poimt
pookpooiac: wait a little bit
bryamatt [11k\]: i'm a newb and i glaze over most of his commentary
Sabbaticus [6k\]: rats, I'm not watching redmond right now
uberaji [?\]: only a stupid human would r10
BongoBob [-\]: Tictac, are you there with them by chance? if so, flash a little message to him to move Q10 to Q9 on his board :p
Watching: I think Redmond is okay, I like him.  
weaknoob: the numbers on the live stream are backwards
murky [?\]: game room very quite
weaknoob: look at the side of the board also has the letter I \\
pookpooiac: here ke jie comment on twitter https://twitter.com/thegoblognet/status/708830944061485057
papabearx3 [7k\]: he is nice but he is so knowledgeable that i could see how new people might be a little overwhelmed
GoIngo [?\]: interest is like in Apollo 13 a moon program
Trevoke [?\]: IIRC, Dosaku is credited with using / coining / spreading the tewari technique, yes?
vasdvasdv [6k\]: Excuse me, d5 is the key point
azblueeyes [8k\]: b8  for me
papabearx3 [7k\]: i like the balance between them both
Nick23 [1d\]: Trevoke: yes
GoIngo [?\]: we need a crash to raise interests again
]
;W[fp]C[Codexus [7k?\]: I prefer the style of coordinate used on the stream actually
LongLost [7k\]: DeepMind fellow said AlphaGo calculates 10,000s of positions per second. Imagine the nest of configurations that went into sifting out d9.
murky [?\]: which site is raymond's commenting?
vasdvasdv [6k\]: Crosscut is only way to make use of e4
gogonuts [4d\]: wow, redmonds suggestion played
Syptryn [2d\]: hmmm
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Okay, I caught the D9 explanation, but why didn't W D10?
BongoBob [-\]: thank you :)
papabearx3 [7k\]: i love this stream i wish we could get something like this regularly for other nations
Azal [2d\]: mmmm 
Watching: (How did Tictactoe send that message!?)
papabearx3 [7k\]: i feel spoiled these last few days. to think korea has go tv and live broadcasts all the time
pookpooiac: david silver say the next version of alphago that doesn't require pro game database may be totally different style than the current version
voevius [5k\]: he fixed the stone ;-)
RAmor [24k?\]: yey r11
BongoBob [-\]: Through the neural net!
asdfa: redmond said this is slow

;B[ck]C[Watching: Huh.
rsun [-\]: alpha will make our eyes pop out within 10 moves

pookpooiac: but more time = more tired

Syptryn [2d\]: P black wins = 51%
BongoBob [-\]: right arrow key, or just drag to the right

Yubi [?\]: Oops
bryamatt [11k\]: Cho was awesome. is she back tonight?
Yubi [?\]: Nvm
weaknoob: yep
Tictactoe [-\]: that's why korean children learn baduk so quickly, their teachers are fast ^^
voevius [5k\]: yeah, cho rules. She's just having so much fun explaining and commenting
rsun [-\]: b has more potential on top, cut is not that severe
Parasyte [?\]: wow, black overplay?
gogonuts [4d\]: in fairness, garlock is ok today, but I'm already allergic
Syptryn [2d\]: Cut!
archron0 [4k\]: where is cho commentary?
Eternal6k [4k\]: Lol
hongsuu: cut first think later
funhouse [2k\]: yes, she starts her awesomeness in about 10 minutes
GoIngo [?\]: allergy is a problem...
BongoBob [-\]: I don't think b has felt a need to overplay.
Parasyte [?\]: yeah cut
rsun [-\]: cut is kiai for sure, but it may not be good
pookpooiac: love cho, but she's cheering too much on lee sedol that it might give me a wrong impression on the current state of the board
Watching: Redmond is nice too.  He's relaxed and explains terminology too.
Syptryn [2d\]: I would cut then think
weaknoob: Ash evil dead style shoot first think never
Syptryn [2d\]: white is strong bot
Watching: Idunno, I think Cho was very appreciative of AlphaGo.
gogonuts [4d\]: bot is b
Azal [2d\]: cut
Watching: At least yesterday.
Tictactoe [-\]: in teaching it's important to bring your enthousiasm and fun to encourage the student, it's almost like cabaret
LongLost [7k\]: My ban message was: "Disrespecting Chris Garlock, AGA Communications Director, Game 2" -- apologies.
bryamatt [11k\]: klatuu... verada... ne*achoo*....
funhouse [2k\]: Cho is excellent at showing and explaining possible variations
USSRMan [3d\]: AlphaGo plays like Shusaku who has learned modern joseki
hongsuu: i learned much more with redmond than any other teacher in my entire life... and this just by 4 videos
rsun [-\]: b may sacrifice 3 stones for moyo, which would be very interesting
Syptryn [2d\]: if white does not cut, then I am shamed for humans
Yubi [?\]: He will cut
Syptryn [2d\]: implies that LSD confidence has been destroyed
qzx1198 [18k?\]: what is moyo
fluidistic [-\]: nah those stones are gonna live imo
Azal [2d\]: yeah... w must be careful of moyo
Parasyte [?\]: yeah, cut is a must man
Syptryn [2d\]: LSD should cut + think later, Alphago excels at thinking in opponents time
Watching: I've always called Moyo effectively influence.
fluidistic [-\]: lee played slow earlier. looks like he ain't gonna cut next move to me
Watching: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Moyo
Syptryn [2d\]: ANy time he spends think implies ALphago will play better move
voevius [5k\]: alphago playing on the other side of the board, you make one mistake and you have ultra moyo in your nose
rsun [-\]: moyo is like mayo, very thick and creamy
USGO1 [-\]: Thank you TicTacToe!!!!
Watching: So...
pookpooiac: lee sedol really needs more time
Watching: After watching this start, does anyone also think that Lee will chose to finish this game?
Syptryn [2d\]: Crazystone recommends E_9
rsun [-\]: and if you fall into a pool of mayo, you'd have to swim really hard
DemonStyle [3d?\]: Gu Li says 's hane is overplay and Lee should cut without thinking
LongLost [7k\]: AlphaGo creating the "palace" on the bottom last night -- and other big spaces -- point efficinecy optimization. Big board thinking.
Syptryn [2d\]: reduce black shance of winning from 51% to 50%
hongsuu: e9 leads to disaster
gogonuts [4d\]: feels like alphago is getting a too good result with a weak group again
Jermelle [?\]: e9 gonna be fun
danielhast [4k\]: I suspect AlphaGo will pull through somehow, but W looks pretty good here
bryamatt [11k\]: we should always cut without thinking right?
hongsuu: no
Watching: E9 seems like a bad idea, I think AlphaGo knows that move is stronger for him.
zeven [?\]: AlphaGo is getting cocky
iceweasel [-\]: better to cut and lose then never to have cut at all
masek [?\]: big deal
voevius [5k\]: as an 11k, yes.
bryamatt [11k\]: let your opponent prove you wrong
ausrussell [4k\]: Lee is thinking too much... should play with human instinct
rsun [-\]: not against alphago
DemonStyle [3d?\]: More "without fear/second-guessing", I guess
weaknoob: If LSD goes 0-5 I want to see a 8 hour game with 4-5 pros against Alpha
Syptryn [2d\]: CS: E9 recommended, P(Black win) 51%.1 ---> 5.10%
Tictactoe [-\]: yes j3 provoked both b4 and f4
USSRMan [3d\]: white probably gonna cut but need to read out a few variations
funhouse [2k\]: but "hane at the head of 2 stones"  "there's death in the hane" etc. . .
fluidistic [-\]: can't kill alphago.  cut it and both parts live as alpha and go
Watching: Actually, I take it back, I like E9 suddenly.
Sabbaticus [6k\]: So it's a bannable offense to disrespect Chris Garlock, too?
Syptryn [2d\]: cut then think

iceweasel [-\]: disappointed...
bryamatt [11k\]: after game 3 I don't blame him
Winrry [9k?\]: so passive
Syptryn [2d\]: That's a move I expected 3k to play when I bully them/...
USSRMan [3d\]: game 3 was a slaughter
pookpooiac: we should wait alphago play itself for 6 more months and then let Ke Jie play against alphago
vasdvasdv [6k\]: Choice was cut or resign
oonicks: after the cut the w and b groups are in equal peril
Syptryn [2d\]: To be honest LSD b=played best in Game 1 when he was not afraid of Alphago
oonicks: i dont think that is too great
fluidistic [-\]: do pro generally reach counting or they resign like zen?
Syptryn [2d\]: he used less time and had ore oppertunities to win

nuts [1k\]: i think 2 stones.  i've watched most of the last two games and it hasn't seemed like LSD  had a chance really
gogonuts [4d\]: i think ke jie can still win
Winrry [9k?\]: fly?
USSRMan [3d\]: i doubt lee sedol can beat fan hui with 2 stones handi
rsun [-\]: b playing very normal moves, except for e4
Buddy514 [5k?\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s   AGA Stream is up
GoForFun [2k\]: @botBot: LOL
tim5407 [3k\]: I understand that USSRMan
zesty [?\]: before next match, ag will play a few million more games ....
botBot [?\]: e4 = i sacriface my stones so you might have a chance to win, human
azblueeyes [8k\]: but if the game size was made 17 by 17 or 20 by 20....it would take top pro a few weeks to be up to speed...and how long for alphago?
tim5407 [3k\]: but Alphago is on a whole new level that no one ever witnessed before
kaliya [-\]: no, version is frozen
dddwyp [19k\]: K16!
Julian1d: Given that the strongest player in the world is getting shut out, humans are unlikely to be able to spot AlphaGo's weakness. Watching the AI v. AI games would show some, though.
ZeNit [?\]: Give the pros a few games to figure out the bots weaknesses and I think they will start winning
GoIngo [?\]: interesting; cs back to 50 %
thomas [2k\]: J16
blau3: Are k4 or k5 good keshi for W (after his heavy upper side stuff is out, that is)?
Deterra [11k?\]: Why have a square board at all?  Why not a tetris piece shaped board?
js13 [1k\]: or w just step down it levels knew it already won last 3 match
Cyphase [?\]: kaliya, in this match maybe
fluidistic [-\]: maybe CS preferred M16
thomas [2k\]: Try to make it miai 
Syptryn [2d\]: really, my KS still says 53%
Azal [2d\]: o.o
botBot [?\]: remember.. AlphaGo is still in Alpha... if it becomes BetaGo?!
nuts [1k\]: it's 100%
kaliya [-\]: Yes in this match
matiej [7k\]: Yay AGA is with Myungwan Kim again, I love his commentary, best english one i seen so far.
Tictactoe [-\]: the size of the goboard might have been related to the days in a year
Watching: I made that joke yesterday.
Syptryn [2d\]: My CS prferrred o-18
Syptryn [2d\]: lol
GoIngo [?\]: lol
fluidistic [-\]: ok nice Syptryn
GoIngo [?\]: what is your hardware syptryn?
tim5407 [3k\]: What kind of style would Betago take?
Azal [2d\]: ok.. what says zen?
USSRMan [3d\]: I prefer black's position but I don't have an internal MC probability calculator in my head
Watching: Tengen and watches what the person does.
Watching: :D
Julian1d: Thanks for AGA stream link. :)
Syptryn [2d\]: Core i7, Surface 4
GoIngo [?\]: my is slower
Tictactoe [-\]: early calendars weren't very accurated
botBot [?\]: Beta go will start with A1
GoIngo [?\]: dual core notebook
tim5407 [3k\]: Beta enough lol
hongsuu: i must sleep
Trevoke [?\]: Redmond just made a joke about pulling the plug to win against AlphaGo.
geek [?\]: the ke jie stream is hilarious when you do not speak english
fluidistic [-\]: 2013 or 2015 version of crazstyone?
Trevoke [?\]: Good to know we're all pragmatic here.
Watching: EVERYONE.
Watching: M16
Corvin [3k\]: botBot said: "remember.. AlphaGo is still in Alpha... if it becomes BetaGo?!" LMAO
Codexus [7k?\]: AlphaGo could lose to a ddos
Watching: Everyone thinks about BetaGo.
Anatoly [2d?\]: Redmond suggested how to bead AlphaGo: "just pull the plag"
Corvin [3k\]: Is beta means better?
Watching: Or scissors.  Lmfao.
blau3: Or W L10 (w reference to Shusaku?)
Watching: Miter saw.
USSRMan [3d\]: its in the cloud
Corvin [3k\]: *does
voevius [5k\]: it's a google product now, it will never go into beta
USSRMan [3d\]: hard to pull plug 
pipu [6d\]: where is the ke jie stream?
zife [-\]: ethernet?
gogonuts [4d\]: between humans this position might be ok, but it's too bot friendly for b for lee to win
bryamatt [11k\]: is h17 a bad move?
BigDoug [-\]: the admins will continue to boot anyone who uses acronyms for bad words
BongoBob [-\]: it will just become GOogle.
Syptryn [2d\]: computers are thinkings....
Syptryn [2d\]: same time
ithisa [25k\]: Just kill Aja Huang with the scissors instead...
thomas [2k\]: -_-
storn [2k\]: Hi everyone. Lee color?
indogo [11k?\]: beta is better than alpha in term of software develop
thomas [2k\]: that's ridiculous
Syptryn [2d\]: thinking a long time is not a good stretegy against alphago
Lasagne [4k\]: is alphaG also thinking on Lee's turn?
USSRMan [3d\]: j16
Eternal6k [4k\]: W
hongsuu: lee is w
storn [2k\]: Thanks!
glasszee [2k\]: alphago isn't thnking during lee's turn
fluidistic [-\]: w near 1 hour on the clock?
voevius [5k\]: i don't think it will
botBot [?\]: all time = AlphaGo's time
Syptryn [2d\]: j17 ?
voevius [5k\]: i think alpha go's algo only runs after a move is made.
botBot [?\]: so dont think giving more time will help LSD
storn [2k\]: I like w here
Trevoke [?\]: Whoa.
Trevoke [?\]: j16 
storn [2k\]: Stable points
GoIngo [?\]: lee sill run in byoyomi time again
Azal [2d\]: j17 kinda bad
USSRMan [3d\]: lol I called j16
blau3: we could utilize "YSD" = Yi Sedol to acquiesce our admins
GoIngo [?\]: will run
Syptryn [2d\]: Nope, from Nature paper, Alphago runs its algorithm whenever
Trevoke [?\]: Massive sabaki
Tictactoe [-\]: 9p are human said redmond
bromeas [1k?\]: alphago 1:34 lSD 1:09
voevius [5k\]: really? all the time?
Syptryn [2d\]: so, Alphago is building more accurate statistics during LSD's thinking
Syptryn [2d\]: Yup
fluidistic [-\]: thx bromeas
botBot [?\]: why not?
hongsuu: i have a question, if they make alphago run in background running continous games instead of this one, is it considered cheating?
edlee [1k\]: blau, nice suggestion :)
pipu [6d\]: j16?
Syptryn [2d\]: It emphasize smost likely moves, but given more time, it starts exploring less likely ones
glasszee [2k\]: wow thanks syptryn
botBot [?\]: you mean you dont think while your opponent is thinking?
]
;W[id]C[bromeas [1k?\]: j16 played
]
;B[hc]C[Syptryn [2d\]: Thus, the more LSD waits, the more like Alphago stumbles on a brilliant move Pros don't usually play
voevius [5k\]: i see, so it predicts say 10 moves for the human and kicks of the mcts for those moves?
botBot [?\]: is it cheating if you are thinking and AlphaGo is not thinking?
USSRMan [3d\]: pretty standard sabaki techniques imo
pulsar [?\]: all the strong go AIs think during opponents time
ruby [2d\]: 僵尸流
vasdvasdv [6k\]: Alphago is just ruthless
pulsar [?\]: it's a fairly standad thing
dddwyp [19k\]: H15
indogo [11k?\]: alphago process simulating human, so indeed he is running background process
pipu [6d\]: 拐
BongoBob [-\]: if a player doesn't want to think on thier opponent's turn then that's thier own thing.
arcturus [2k?\]: the use of alpha go's time is actually more related to the physical transfer of informtion across an incredible network of servers, presumably
botBot [?\]: i repeat.. all the time = AlphaGo's time
nuts [1k\]: yes, ruthless
Syptryn [2d\]: m16 
hemster [-\]: w looks heavy..
blau3: W L15 and run
azblueeyes [8k\]: botbot if i was consulting another friend i would consider that cheating...but Alphago was "frozen" before the series started so it is not playing against another bot as it did in training
kaliya [-\]: J15
thomas [2k\]: ^
Tictactoe [-\]: 3 stones are called heavy, single and two stones chains are considered light
GoIngo [?\]: is ke jie on air right now?
Syptryn [2d\]: P (b win ) = 54%
LongLost [7k\]: I believe there is only a finite amount of calculations that beneficially add to calculated better probability.
USSRMan [3d\]: lee sedol very thick this game
oonicks: i assume all bots agreed with h17 and the percentage did not change?
USSRMan [3d\]: not his usual style
thomas [2k\]: or even J14
voevius [5k\]: alphago also consumes massive amount of energy, compared to our human.
Tictactoe [-\]: go is played by orc alot one two many
voevius [5k\]: human still more efficient ;-)
Syptryn [2d\]: Alphago uses the policy network to decide which mores are likely explored first/in more detail
Ahamay [7d?\]: Ke Jie stream (Chinese) at http://sports.letv.com/match/122344003.html?ref=index_focus_1#live/1020160303213247
thomas [2k\]: tho some demeted part of me wants to J17. But getting out seems better
GoIngo [?\]: my cs bot did not understand black o18
Syptryn [2d\]: so the longer ALphago gets to think, the more 'less likely to be good' moves are explored
hongsuu: why they never show lee sedol face/
hongsuu: ?
pipu [6d\]: thanks ahamay
GoIngo [?\]: by alphago
Trevoke [?\]: Lee left his seat after making his move and isn't back yet
LEIBNIZ [2k\]: Will this game be saved in KGS archive?
GoIngo [?\]: thx ahamay
jellyroll: silly robot, tsukes are for kids
USSRMan [3d\]: O18 is pretty easy to understand
voevius [5k\]: google translate: "Go man-machine war Shishi vs AlphaGo"
GoIngo [?\]: maybe not for all bots  o18 easy
bromeas [1k?\]: leibniz you can donload all match sgf files from gogameguru
USSRMan [3d\]: why not m16
Syptryn [2d\]: I would M-16
bromeas [1k?\]: download*
blau3: or k15 aiming at both h15 and j17
matiej [7k\]: one drawback of strong computers will be, that you wont be able to take breakes like that, cause of cheating acusations. :(
Azal [2d\]: m16 slow and helps b
matiej [7k\]: this happened in chess
hongsuu: why w is taking this situations?
Azal [2d\]: r11 will be damaged
Higanbana [?\]: Stream in English with 9d pro commentary: https://gogameguru.com/alphago-4/
BongoBob [-\]: redmond's variation is very heavy... why
LongLost [7k\]: Will need to bring in TSA to check players for hidden mics.
Azal [2d\]: i think w needs to play lightly
Deterra [11k?\]: I think w needs to play mightily.
USSRMan [3d\]: its more of an issue for chess tournaments now that an iphone can play at 2900 level
hongsuu: ke jie must play soon
oldguy [4d\]: sorry I am on mobile client again and cannot see which is Alphago
Julian1d: Chris Garlock's questions often lead Redmond to explain boring things. ;)
hongsuu: no..
BongoBob [-\]: AlphaGo is B
USSRMan [3d\]: not sure how strong crazy stone or zen would be on an iphone
tim5407 [3k\]: This position looks so bad for white even to my kyu eye
Trevoke [?\]: Lee just sat down again
oldguy [4d\]: thx bongobob!
bromeas [1k?\]: oldguy Black
oldguy [4d\]: ok!
tim5407 [3k\]: j16 and g14 work too well
cekalo [1k\]: Chris Garlock is okay stop talking trash about him
Syptryn [2d\]: m16 ?
Syptryn [2d\]: I preferm16 
Syptryn [2d\]: can black double gane if white M16?
tim5407 [3k\]: I mean h16 and g14 work too well
LEIBNIZ [2k\]: Thanks Higanbana
LongLost [7k\]: Funny how certain people's purported innocence and nobility requires an armed guard to prevent candid observations.
rsun [-\]: the promised kami no itte is going to show up any time now
Higanbana [?\]: You can also see his commentary on previous games on youtube
indogo [11k?\]: m16 is heavy i think
bromeas [1k?\]: AG 1:33 LSD 1:02
BongoBob [-\]: w undercut on both sides.. needs to jump out.. M16 would be heavy
matiej [7k\]: kami no itte on tengen plsss :)
Azal [2d\]: l15
colorless [-\]: black so solid on both sides and black has lower stones on both sides
colorless [-\]: really tough for white
zeven [?\]: Lee went to ask CrazyStone what he should play
USSRMan [3d\]: i dont see any light way to handle this position
Higanbana [?\]: I think the fact that AlphaGo is maximizing his chance of winning rather than maximizng the expected difference in scores is leading people to underestimate alphago's strength
Azal [2d\]: sacrifice m17 
cekalo [1k\]: Lee is losing too much time 
rsun [-\]: the only move that resembles a kami no itte is q11
thomas [2k\]: *using*
Trevoke [?\]: How about ~k14 ? 
GoIngo [?\]: @zeven: it might indeed help him a bit
Eternal6k [4k\]: <.<
luxfiam [?\]: Has it been mentioned at any point if AG can use opponents' time for evaluation?
Kael [2d\]: it can
Kael [2d\]: It's set up to use opponents time to think during tournaments
rsun [-\]: but it seems very unlikely
gogonuts [4d\]: w can prob settle, but no way to settle in sente - b will ravage the right side
Cyphase [?\]: he's doing better than game 3 as far as comparing his time to alphago's time
Syptryn [2d\]: m16 m16 m16 
Cyphase [?\]: not much though
BrainCore [3k\]: does actually someone know whether alpha go will still keep thinking on lee sedols time? Seems like nobody discussed this in here yet.
Hmm: Oh a 9d game at the same time
colorless [-\]: this board is also less complex than game 3
hongsuu: game 1 was the best
zeven [?\]: @luxfiam, yes Redmond confirmed he talked with the developers off camera about that and they said AG does use opponent's time to think
hongsuu: at least it ended no res
Higanbana [?\]: It probably is, even Zen kept the part of the minimax tree that the opponent plays in to
Kael [2d\]: @Briancore: it does according to something I read
]
;W[jg]C[rsun [-\]: w is eager to make some kami no itte
Azal [2d\]: ok
oonicks: it would be bad for the hardware if it could not
BongoBob [-\]: there we go
hongsuu: kami no ite!!!
blau3: Ah, W has to move fast
BongoBob [-\]: nice and light
Syptryn [2d\]: ?
LongLost [7k\]: I like that move.
Azal [2d\]: a bit too light maybe
zesty [?\]: no self-respecting computer programmer would waste the time not thinking
kaliya [-\]: Wow
Syptryn [2d\]: sacrifice all?
Higanbana [?\]: Have the developers said whether or not AlphaGo was specifically trained to beat Lee Sedol?
rsun [-\]: now this move may prompt for an even more kami no itte
ZeNit [?\]: That's very light
Azal [2d\]: m16 was just wrong
ausrussell [4k\]: Helium light
Ahamay [7d?\]: w aiming at some cut on the left
matiej [7k\]: it wasnt accorging to interviews
gogonuts [4d\]: k13 raises my spirits
voevius [5k\]: no, i think all the sedol games are already in the neural nets.
USSRMan [3d\]: light like a butterfly
Ahamay [7d?\]: but alphago already read it all...
Rexxar [1k\]: i wish redmond would be more passionate as a commentator
BongoBob [-\]: syp, neither of those top stones are important right now
BongoBob [-\]: no cutting
USSRMan [3d\]: lets see how alphago attack light stones
Blindspot [1d\]: like helium
GoIngo [?\]: hmm, tenuki moves by Lee are highest chance that his evaluation frops
kaliya [-\]: If we reverse the board, would Alpha play k13 maybe!?
matiej [7k\]: it had LSD games from database treated on same priority as every other of thousands of pro games
GoIngo [?\]: drops
Buddy514 [5k?\]: It is good to play lightly and reduce the potential moyo I think based on previous games.
Rexxar [1k\]: he always appears a little bit bored
royu [4d\]: omg, the "transistor-reddening move" has been played
Tictactoe [-\]: yes hitting into thin air is hard
rsun [-\]: that's close enough to my prediction
botBot [?\]: developing an AI so expensive to just beat LSD is a waste of money
ZeNit [?\]: nice one royu
gogonuts [4d\]: lets hope ke jie doesnt look at it and says what is this? :-)
Trevoke [?\]: Well, here we go. Moyo and counter-moyos. :)
Trevoke [?\]: B q10 
kaliya [-\]: Again the same shoulder hit lol
indogo [11k?\]: :)
Hanne [?\]: developing an AI to beat alphago, will be even more expensive
voevius [5k\]: let's see what alpha go will do
geek [?\]: Why is AGA stream not commenting game's recent moves
USSRMan [3d\]: ke jie is a loud mouth
hongsuu: q10...
]
;B[pj]C[tim5407 [3k\]: lol USSRMan
indogo [11k?\]: haha
kaliya [-\]: What is Ke Jie saying?
GoIngo [?\]: ke jie knows what he is speaking about
botBot [?\]: AlphaGo is just the beginning
Azal [2d\]: lol
LongLost [7k\]: Myungwan always ~20 moves behind, lost in variations.
Syptryn [2d\]: CS recommends J-17
Jermelle [?\]: kami no itte
Higanbana [?\]: It would be nice of Google to publish the list of moves that AlphaGo expected the opponent to play
Kael [2d\]: alphago like "This worked last time"
blau3: obvious leaning attack now
gogonuts [4d\]: game on!
hongsuu: obviously b move = kami no ite
trippin [3k\]: shoulder hit!
hongsuu: reverse kami no ite
dddwyp [19k\]: white R10
USSRMan [3d\]: 18 yo who thinks he knows everything, we've all been there
royu [4d\]: loves these shoulder hits
geek [?\]: haha
azblueeyes [8k\]: pincer in the middle!!!!
tim5407 [3k\]: nice to know even foreign men think hes a loud mouth lol
botBot [?\]: G10 = this moyo is mine!
Tictactoe [-\]: this game develops pretty well balanced
kaliya [-\]: Alpha as usual trying to make a huge box, this time center-low
botBot [?\]: Q10*
Azal [2d\]: whay says cs?
Syptryn [2d\]: CS loves this move
rsun [-\]: shoulder hits are going to be played all over the board by amateurs now
Azal [2d\]: -.-
hongsuu: botbot, actually g10 is interesting for w
hongsuu: 3 hits :)
Syptryn [2d\]: P(black win) --> 55%
thomas [2k\]: It's forcing white to defend 3 groups imho.
kaliya [-\]: Lol rsun
GoIngo [?\]: cs did not like K13 for white
Eternal6k [4k\]: Great now W will think for another hour
LongLost [7k\]: Next black move will be beautiful.
tim5407 [3k\]: omg q10 again
Julian1d: This is a very nice move. :)
USSRMan [3d\]: this is called the shoulder hitting game
tim5407 [3k\]: 4-0 already
indogo [11k?\]: shoulder hit is about influence :)
botBot [?\]: B is good at making this more complicated
Syptryn [2d\]: q11 ?
thomas [2k\]: Q11 seems forced
azblueeyes [8k\]: o10 
Azal [2d\]: r14
Tictactoe [-\]: if sedol delivers a half point loss today, it would prove that humans are still able to play an excellent game
rpenrose [2d\]: a half point loss wouldn't mean much
Trevoke [?\]: Tictactoe: I don't know if that's true
gogonuts [4d\]: lee sedol is having a flashback to move 37 game 2
kaliya [-\]: Yes
GoIngo [?\]: no tictactoe
USSRMan [3d\]: well, i think its more like alphago winning by 10 points, and throw away 9.5
botBot [?\]: i really hope LSD dont resign and play to the end..
Jermelle [?\]: Is he washing his face
thomas [2k\]: what about Q14?
GoIngo [?\]: 0.5-loss against bot does not mean anything
tsukiatari [1d\]: redmond is so out of touch, saying that e4 is unusual
rpenrose [2d\]: that would likely mean that AlphaGo was just optimizing its win probability
Higanbana [?\]: I don't think it's that straightforward TicTacGo, humans play to maximize ponit difference, AlphaGo plays to maximize chance of winning
rsun [-\]: w has no development potential now
Gelya [2d\]: Lee seems to be in good position. 😊
USSRMan [3d\]: 0.5 loss could mean alphago massively ahead by endgame
rsun [-\]: w can only hope to reduce b's influence effectively
thomas [2k\]: aiming at N14 ish
Trevoke [?\]: I'm betting on .... Something like ... k9 
Kael [2d\]: When I play monte carlo go programs I can tell when I'm behind because they start playing stupid moves in endgame
LongLost [7k\]: AlphaGo has no honor. Tee-totalling.
Kael [2d\]: Which I interpret as them going "I'm going to win even by filling in my own internal liberty"
BongoBob [-\]: Go Seigen ghost in the machine?
Ahamay [7d?\]: time for the Hikaru no AlphaGo meshup of the day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynZIu1uZN04
Higanbana [?\]: AlphaGo doesn't just win by 0.5, he wins by 0.5 with 100% certainty which is worth more than a 30 point win with 95% certainty
Blindspot [1d\]: alfa go is a troll
Kael [2d\]: exactly
BigDoug [-\]: please keep the comments only about the game
Tictactoe [-\]: redmond mentions Kitani unconvential choices
indogo [11k?\]: don't touch q10
Sabbaticus [6k\]: about the game
ruby [2d\]: lol Ahamay
Rephos [23k\]: .
USSRMan [3d\]: unless lee can enter endgame relatively even and lose by 0.5, I wont be convinced that the game was close

;B[oj]C[Rexxar [1k\]:  Hikaru no AlphaGo - i laughed hard
thomas [2k\]: gues not
Syptryn [2d\]: I feel LSD spends too much time on intuitive moves
Kael [2d\]: that was hilarious
tim5407 [3k\]: p10...
hongsuu: redmond learned database
Syptryn [2d\]: he needs to save time for the big funds
thomas [2k\]: N12
Trevoke [?\]: Ironically, the only way I could really be convinced is if a bunch of score estimators and other AI showed a relatively even score AND chance of winning throughout the game

Winrry [9k?\]: chinese commendary
royu [4d\]: i wonder how Lee Sedol will be affected by these matches with AlphaGo
Rotfuchs [3k\]: any word on what ke jie has said about the game?
gogonuts [4d\]: poorly
Long [?\]: he gets stronger
royu [4d\]: as in, will it affect his psychology in future tournaments
USSRMan [3d\]: He will retire from go
drueknmstr [3d\]: i think pro players must be psychologically very resilient
kaliya [-\]: Well royo, I think he will understand how one feels overwhelmed, like his (human) opponents ;)
rsun [-\]: gogo you figured out what ke jie said?
gogonuts [4d\]: no
Tictactoe [-\]: true drueknmstr
Ph1xi3 [-\]: Didn't he say he is inspired to play such formidable opponent?
gogonuts [4d\]: i only look at his fingers :-)
rsun [-\]: whoa
LongLost [7k\]: Korean 9p mentioned that Lee Sedol has more resilient heart than anyone he had ever met.
edlee [1k\]: dm, pros in general are very strong mentally yes ( some more than others :)
Sabbaticus [6k\]: I don't know why you guys are worried about Lee Sedol. This is a guy who is disciplined enough to use 60 second byo-yomi and play at the last second. He'll be fine :)
USSRMan [3d\]: lee will feel he needs to take a handicap from AG, something he never had to do with anyone since he was 13

;B[ni]C[BongoBob [-\]: Alphago has +35 minutes over LSD
rsun [-\]: now that's new
kaliya [-\]: Alpha desperately trying to box center :D
matiej [7k\]: hane everything
Kael [2d\]: To get computers in on the psychological game, there should be a big LED readout of alpha go's estimation of it's probability of winning
thomas [2k\]: Oh, makes sense to add one
Syptryn [2d\]: if LSD o-12, he loses
hongsuu: b almost fix center

blau3: W o10 B o12 very hard on W

GoIngo [?\]: some run crazy stone on their machines
Hanne [?\]: ok thansk
Sabbaticus [6k\]: sorry to be a total newbie about this, but doesn't W have a move like J5 to reduce the moyo?

hongsuu: Sabbaticus, first w needs to live in top
hjsdkfjg: m11.
BongoBob [-\]: yes, but he would need to live on top first
Hanne [?\]: s11 ofc

Hanne [?\]: now w to double hane!
azblueeyes [8k\]: w still has g12

ThiGar [4k\]: wow, w gets both hane's!
RedLeaf [5d\]: Sabbaticus, how do you get the idea taht w has a 15 point lead?
rsun [-\]: whoever finds a kami no itte first will win

indogo [11k?\]: haha no double hane

Azal [2d\]: for w
kaliya [-\]: W H6 or smth before it's too late
hongsuu: sabbaticus, your countinng is eliminating the sequences in middle, white is in pure gote, and center will be done faster
RedLeaf [5d\]: just counting in soild points alone, they are about even, b has massive influence in tthe centre
thomas [2k\]: alphago uses thickness so well.
tsukiatari [1d\]: those english commentators are in a state of perpetual confusion

godard: Redmond is amazing
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: may i continue the positive comments about redmond
hongsuu: sabbaticus, w is not ahead, because the sequences are actually points, white is ahead if game ends now, but it makes nonsense
voevius [5k\]: yeah he's awesome.
ghgfh: Redmond is handsome
Tictactoe [-\]: redmond made already three excellent lengthly shows 
hongsuu: how can you say it is ahead if the order of moves must end to close the entire game?
Azal [2d\]: if w n10, then b h5
Asuna [2k\]: ooh alpha go?
Sabbaticus [6k\]: I wasn't saying W's ahead. I was saying that if he can reduce the center enough, he might have a chance?
hongsuu: its cheating rules
kaliya [-\]: W could enter the box and threaten a ladder breaker
blackdraco [7k\]: run lee run
Kael [2d\]: it's unreasonable to expect redmond to read it all out .. while he's talking, replaying things, and not really focusing 
hongsuu: yes that could be true

drueknmstr [3d\]: you could interactively explore the mcts try as it is being explored, etc
drueknmstr [3d\]: *mcts tree
K5 [5k?\]: A lot of the difficulties anticipation/understanding Alphago stem from the fact that it is maximising win probability, not expected margin of victory. The bot is stronger than the commentators, for whom anyway distinguishing the diference is not easy. Hence, several of the so-called "bad moves" may well be ones that yield points but which make later reading easier, and therefore increase win probability by decreasing uncertainty.

drueknmstr [3d\]: it would be cool to see the hot points identified by the policy network
Tictactoe [-\]: redmonds thinks topside might be ko
hammo [5k\]: i feel like white and black have already read out L&D of top group
hongsuu: sooner or later google will put it into 100% winrate, and godmode on, no more on % , but a totally crush
trippin [3k\]: cho says w can possibly live in top
pipu [5d\]: ke jie suggests j10
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: did they think having 2 commentators was necessary to generate intercommentator chit chat? i think would be fine for redmond to talk to audience he doesnt need another human there
trippin [3k\]: oh not cho, haley
hongsuu: pipu, where ke jie is commenting????????
BongoBob [-\]: Acerolion, alphago fairly consistently keeps his time per move to about a minute.
Julian1d: I would love to see more of the AI's data.
pipu [5d\]: hongsuu - http://sports.letv.com/match/122344003.html?ref=index_focus_1#live/1020160303213247
hongsuu: TY!!!
hammo [5k\]: at this point lsd should be given handis to see what would happen
pipu [5d\]: but all the people he is commentating with are quite annoying
goren22 [2k\]: h15 or j17?
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: id like to see shorter time controls like the kind fan hui won 2 games on
hammo [5k\]: maybe a blitz?
Bazzi [1d\]: Chu hunhyun said that w's J10 is possible move.
Tictactoe [-\]: haya-go could be interesting indeed, but i won't be relaying those
Eternal6k [4k\]: LS don't need less time
gogonuts [4d\]: aga channel with hajin and myungwan like a funeral now
bbred [3k\]: shrug, can the humans realy comment the game?
GoIngo [?\]: funeral, how?
rsun [-\]: h18
]
;W[ik]C[gogonuts [4d\]: very sad and hopeless
cekalo [1k\]: wow
KoyoToya [-\]: Lee Sedols group died
BongoBob [-\]: so light...
hammo [5k\]: whats goin on here
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Wow, there it is
KoyoToya [-\]: They're having a funeral for it
geek [?\]: finally a human move
RedLeaf [5d\]: pipu, did ke jie say anything about the game?
Le0na99 [4k\]: what?
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: which group died?
BongoBob [-\]: w throwing a stone up the deep well.
nu [2k\]: ag pushes on L line?
Bazzi [1d\]: Go Sedol !
oonicks: it's easy:) now lee sedol moved and we can't understand, now alphago moved and we can't understand
drueknmstr [3d\]: they are talking about top group lllllll0
hongsuu: what ke jie is saying?
ToBeStrong [1k\]: oh my
m1m [1k\]: j16 m17 n17 all these stones are weasted\\
zesty [?\]: so light
USSRMan [3d\]: this bot is just invincible
thomas [2k\]: Aiming at L10?
USSRMan [3d\]: convincingly beat lee sedol in 70 moves
gogonuts [4d\]: ke was expecting something like j9
ToBeStrong [1k\]: did someone say shusaku [Insert Kappa\]
goren22 [2k\]: this is so not goig to work.  b will invade left
drueknmstr [3d\]: agree ussrma
GoIngo [?\]: cs at 60% for black now
]
;B[ji]C[USSRMan [3d\]: CS at 60 is basically alphago at 99
blau3: B like swatting a fly away
geomav [7k\]: trying to make a long chain inside black...???
tim5407 [3k\]: K11
tim5407 [3k\]: kami no itte
hammo [5k\]: black is so thick that a chain would get cut like butter
oonicks: better than j10
gogonuts [4d\]: ever since w f4 bs momentum has been irreversible
rsun [-\]: w's only chance is to kill n4 group
blau3: threatening L7 and another 20 points, followed by stuff like P8
BongoBob [-\]: flip the board upside down to get LSD's perspective.. Lee is looking straight up from the bottom of a black well.
pookpooiac: we'd love to know b winrate, please ;)
thomas [2k\]: I guess black didn't like L10
hammo [5k\]: n4 group is common enough that i doubt it could die
rsun [-\]: b wr should be approaching 70% now
pookpooiac: thank you
rsun [-\]: yw lol
Matrok [3k\]: this really reminds me of Cho Chikun vs Takemiya Masaki
drueknmstr [3d\]: like looking into abyss bongobob
Uberdude [2d\]: i don't understand why Lee played f4
BongoBob [-\]: exactly. I wonder if bot made it that way
blau3: not a well, an oubliette rather :-(
Ahamay [7d?\]: E4 -> game over
Uberdude [2d\]: he lost with slow solid moves like that before
pookpooiac: Korea time write article 'AlphaGo cheat' because alphago use strong computer
tim5407 [3k\]: E4 = kami no itte
Ahamay [7d?\]: yes
drueknmstr [3d\]: lol pookpooiac
Answer3 [9d?\]: he is very pathetic. he is always full of confidence, has big pride himself. but he said sorry for everyone yesterday after game
hammo [5k\]: thats the sort of thing north korea time would write
ph [6k\]: pookpoolac: did they suggest what kind of computer would be "fair?" :-)
gogonuts [4d\]: e4 maybe nice, but the problem is f4
USSRMan [3d\]: well he felt game 3 wasa played very poorly
KurataKun [1d\]: please be respectful.
drueknmstr [3d\]: aga channel counts w ahead by about 10 points now
ToBeStrong [1k\]: Does g12 aji work?
hs [2d\]: Fan Hui improved a lot from playing alphago... he went from ranked 633 to the 300s
Bazzi [1d\]: cho hunhyun said Lee may be aiming e8, e9, g12.
Codexus [7k?\]: alphago has 50 min more time
rsun [-\]: w head by 10 points? on another board?
pipu [5d\]: it's just lost in translation, pathetic means, it's very hard on him
darkronin [2d?\]: where did fan hui play? why was it not detected by the news?
Syptryn [2d\]: j11 woot
Uberdude [2d\]: he played in london
KoyoToya [-\]: It was dark
GaretJax [4k?\]: Answer, he said something that correlated with everything we know historically about Go.  He is being proven wrong, yes, and he obviously feels like he can't do enough to win.  But that doesn't make him pathetic.  It makes him human.  
Matrok [3k\]: it was in London in october and it was secret until january
GaretJax [4k?\]: he judged on the past
hs [2d\]: darkronin, see this article. http://www.wired.com/2016/03/sadness-beauty-watching-googles-ai-play-go/
ausrussell [4k\]: behind closed, possibly locked, doors
KoyoToya [-\]: It was, dark*
Uberdude [2d\]: in deepmind office
pipu [5d\]: garetjax, it's just lost in translation
Tictactoe [-\]: they shielded the entire affair from the public to make sure alph was as strong as they hoped
geomav [7k\]: J
Uberdude [2d\]: people involved signed NDSs
Uberdude [2d\]: NDAs
geomav [7k\]: J11
pipu [5d\]: pathetic is a direct translation, means it's hard on him
gogonuts [4d\]: oh, myungwan, there is no catching up ...
darkronin [2d?\]: yes i know. but it only states that fan hui raised to poition #300, not linking to when or what he played
gogonuts [4d\]: and he knows
USSRMan [3d\]: I should've taken the alphago 5-0 sweep bet
KurataSan [3d\]: i wonder... if top 10 pros are gathered to play against alphago, who would win?
gardner [2k\]: I don't think a computer can win lee sedol
geomav [7k\]: Sedol played J11
rsun [-\]: if w gets m3 m4 simultaneously, the game is just even
USSRMan [3d\]: google would not accept this match if they didnt think they can win
Le0na99 [4k\]: :(
USSRMan [3d\]: bad pr otherwise
Tictactoe [-\]: no he didn't
Ahamay [7d?\]: we canot really judge F4 - my guess is that alphago would win the fight too if omitted
gardner [2k\]: no computer has ever won a professional go player
hs [2d\]: after losing his match, fan hui became an adviser when they were training alphago
zeven [?\]: Deep Blue lost its first match vs Kaspirov
gogonuts [4d\]: no, google didn't have to win, just make a game of it
geek [?\]: alpha go did, against fanhui
rsun [-\]: how did redmond know it's the 71st move?!
geomav [7k\]: OOOPs... Michael Redmond played it !!!
botBot [?\]: he counter?
Tictactoe [-\]: don't worry i welcome your help too
botBot [?\]: counted*
Syptryn [2d\]: my Kblizt sitnct is J11
gardner [2k\]: lee sedol is winning
darkronin [2d?\]: my question is still not answer :(
thomas [2k\]: I still want to L10. :S
USSRMan [3d\]: it seems like every top pro thinks alphago is the stronger player
KoyoToya [-\]: Ronin
KoyoToya [-\]: Two people answered
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol reads g12 and o6
zeven [?\]: @USSRMan, didnt Ke Jie say he could beat AlphaGo?
Acerolion [12k?\]: Sedol's not winning
KoyoToya [-\]: Yes zeven
Julian1d: Alphago likely gets a lot of use out of LSD's time when LSD plays slowly.
USSRMan [3d\]: ke jie is 18yo, he just wants publicity
kafkaesque [-\]: Ke Jie is a kid. He might say different after playing it
Le0na99 [4k\]: kejie 19 yo?
KoyoToya [-\]: Nah Ke jie is better than lsd
darkronin [2d?\]: i was asking - where fan hui played, to gain the advancement to world position #300. everyone answered that fan hui improved by working in alphago team. do you see that is not answering my question?
Le0na99 [4k\]: why 18 @@
matanume [11k?\]: parts of this game need time x_X really painful for lee
botBot [?\]: LSD using too much time...
amadis [4k\]: on which move will w resign? i predict 111
gogonuts [4d\]: ke jie still has a chance - he is the only one who's game comments have truly made sense
azblueeyes [8k\]: fanhui Euro champion 
tim5407 [3k\]: I want alphago to 50-0 ke jie
KoyoToya [-\]: Perhaps you should have specified your terms then ronin
darkronin [2d?\]: haha no worries
bbred [3k\]: so is the cash prize going to turn around?
ghgfh: Ke Jie is too young. If he is defeated by Alpha by 0:5, it will ruin his life
geek [?\]: the most interesting live is the original one where you can see lee sedol thinking and beain very excited
berag78: i imagine they have a digital display with the board to look at that could show the move counter
zeven [?\]: @gogonuts, is it possible to get Ke Jie game comments in English?
crazyone [10k?\]: Darkronin, he played in the first European professional tournament and won it. 
BongoBob [-\]: bbred, they stated earlier that the prize would be donated to some charity
USSRMan [3d\]: Im convince alphago is at least 1 stone stronger than lee sedol
bbred [3k\]: ie put the bot on a server, the first human to beat him gets the cash?
Julian1d: Seems very unlikely that current human go players can beat AlphaGo at these settings.
gogonuts [4d\]: no, ke could take it much more naturally - "ok the bots are here now"
USSRMan [3d\]: cant say the same about ke jie
Uberdude [2d\]: maybe alpha go is teaching us that p3 is a mistake
darkronin [2d?\]: thanks, crazyone
gogonuts [4d\]: lee sedol is the one who's taking it too hard
kdbaby14 [6k\]: how the heck Lee only has 20 min?
RedLeaf [5d\]: the aga commentary is amusing! haha, two koreans speaking in english to each other for our sake
cekalo [1k\]: isnt r15 big?
Buddy514 [5k?\]: how long has he been thinking on this move?
bbred [3k\]: I never liked p3
Acerolion [12k?\]: where can i watch the aga commentary?
amadis [4k\]: ke jie alphago match must be kadoban
Tictactoe [-\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw
kadoban [?\]: <.< >.>
Trevoke [?\]: That's the deepmind commentary
Syptryn [2d\]: Comment s from Chinese channel says n14  ando15  are crude moves
Tictactoe [-\]: oh andrew is on another channel
crazyone [10k?\]: Defeated roln11q, breakfast and some more strong players there. 
Tako [-\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s
Femto [2d?\]: http://www.usgo.org/
Syptryn [2d\]: this is from Gu Li 9 dan
Answer3 [9d?\]: it doesn't matter even if ke jie is stroger than lee currently the gap is very slight
Trevoke [?\]: https://gaming.youtube.com/user/USGOWeb/live
Tictactoe [-\]: thx
awesome [3k\]: go g12
K5 [5k?\]: r15 etc. big byt no as urgent as middle imo
bbred [3k\]: j17
rsun [-\]: if lee sedol scores 80/100, ke jie is at most 81, and alpha is probably 95 already
kdbaby14 [6k\]: Lee taking too long...
kdbaby14 [6k\]: he gonna under time pressure again
Answer3 [9d?\]: I've ever seen like yesterday lee's game. he looked like just amateur 5 dan
blau3: B threatening so much at once: j5 P8 G7 (or so) ...
Rexxar [1k\]: he should take time its fine
Bazzi [1d\]: Cho hunhyun said f16 might be a ko.
Acerolion [12k?\]: Sedol should be given infinite time
ghgfh: probably 85, but still not threatening to Alpha
Rexxar [1k\]: 1 min x3 is good enough for the endgame
Asuna [2k\]: bwhen was the last time go getting this much attention?
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: never
kafkaesque [-\]: We don't know how AlphaGo plays when it's in byo yomi. That would be interesting to see
hammo [5k\]: never
blau3: when HnG came out?
Higanbana [?\]: Before previous game, Sedol had stayed up all night with pros analyzing his game (according to Redmond)
rsun [-\]: alpha was in byo yomi in game 2
Higanbana [?\]: The night before the night before the game
GoIngo [?\]: byoyomi would not be problem for alphago
kafkaesque [-\]: ah
azblueeyes [8k\]: go is a language and the two Koreans might even be thinking in english
gogonuts [4d\]: hajin would go down in flames, but atleast she would fight like a cat :-)
Answer3 [9d?\]: how about lighting game
GoIngo [?\]: my wife just said: Lee will not move anymore
gogonuts [4d\]: faster is worse for humans
Jermelle [?\]: your wife is a savage xD
bbred [3k\]: is that the 2eye mask?
hammo [5k\]: lee just escaped, he flipped the board over and jumped out a window
Tictactoe [-\]: yes answer3, play 5 of them to show us ^^
kafkaesque [-\]: They should switch colors a]
;W[gh]C[azblueeyes [8k\]: :)
snowmiku [?\]: it is......coming
LongLost [7k\]: Attack!
Trevoke [?\]: Here we go.
Syptryn [2d\]: Yay!
lofuchi [3k\]: i actually guess this move right! lol
voevius [5k\]: FIGHT!
masek [?\]: Thanks for stream ,  i will listen :)
Jermelle [?\]: Oh?
liptos [3k\]: i hope it was worth the 3 hour for this move
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol has read his ko
masek [?\]: in China it works quite quick
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: gloves off
drueknmstr [3d\]: its good to see lsd's fighting spirit
dehuong [1k\]: Lee will win in the fast game with it
Syptryn [2d\]: B win 58.4%
Trevoke [?\]: Haha Redmond got a high-five for guessing the right move and now he's trying to up the ante, "what happens if I guess THIS MOVE?"
Syptryn [2d\]: Crazy Stone waves and assigbed 1.6% extra to LSD!
RAmor [24k?\]: Now a fight
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: who knows next move b
]
;B[hj]C[Le0na99 [4k\]: oh dehuong :)
tim5407 [3k\]: oh
Answer3 [9d?\]: probably this 120m is most moderate time for Alpha
nu [2k\]: wowz, ag insta response
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: everyone 
gohand2 [1d\]: wow
Trevoke [?\]: That's the move Redmond called
Syptryn [2d\]: Redmond is Alphago!
gohand2 [1d\]: WOW
botBot [?\]: Wow! 
Higanbana [?\]: But he did guess the next move also
sdfsdfdd: dayummmmmm\\
tim5407 [3k\]: Alphago read everything out already
tim5407 [3k\]: GG
gohand2 [1d\]: GG
Julian1d: Good job Redmond. :)
Le0na99 [4k\]: I think Lee will win this game :))
tim5407 [3k\]: props to Redmond tho
GoIngo [?\]: alphamond ;-)
mate105 [1d\]: Dammm
gohand2 [1d\]: no
dehuong [1k\]: alpha plays 1 move/s
gohand2 [1d\]: this looks bad
kaliya [-\]: B is winning and will win
cekalo [1k\]: Lee is out of time again
gogonuts [4d\]: oh man, what happened?
miller [5k\]: i wonder how Sedol would play against Redmond)
Tictactoe [-\]: i ran out of coffee
gohand2 [1d\]: i think the time limit should be canceled
snowmiku [?\]: alphago play so.......fast
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: why does everyone wear suits while playing go should wear most comfortable clothes possible 
gohand2 [1d\]: it is not fair for humans
Le0na99 [4k\]: I guest :3
bbred [3k\]: is bad if h10 came as a supprize
nu [2k\]: lsd getting important phone call from batman
Julian1d: Agree, re: suits!
kaliya [-\]: So we will have games lasting months? Cool
]
;W[ge]C[gohand2 [1d\]: well
azblueeyes [8k\]: :)
azblueeyes [8k\]: :)
gohand2 [1d\]: ig it requires months
bbred [3k\]: a suit is the most comfrotable clothing ever
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: i think you concentrate better if youre totally relaxed most people dont really like suits
gohand2 [1d\]: if*
gohand2 [1d\]: why not
Bazzi [1d\]: Go Sedol !!
zeven [?\]: AlphaGo has an hour more than Lee Sedol....
snowmiku [?\]: @lllllllll0 because go is not just a kind of sport and they try to give respect to the opponent
Answer3 [9d?\]: cutting seems to be bad exchange for lee
kafkaesque [-\]: I love wearing a suit. I just never have a reason
GoIngo [?\]: @kafka: i sell you my
kafkaesque [-\]: Except a funeral. But I don't really look forward to those
]
;B[he]C[IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: why would not wearing a suit be "disrespect"ful to the opponent. seems like childish idea, "dis" your opponent if you dont wear uncomfortable easily soiled garments
bbred [3k\]: show respect to the AI, mmmm that H word again
masek [?\]: They discuss the split of groups
masek [?\]: e10  split and remain tail will run
]
;W[fd]C[MMXVI [3k\]: disrespectful to the game
Le0na99 [4k\]: lol
gohand2 [1d\]: b win
gohand2 [1d\]: noooo
dehuong [1k\]: may be near future, AI will handicap human 2 stones
]
;B[fc]TR[ic][ii][ki]C[Rotfuchs [3k\]: alphago could 2 stones right now probably
gohand2 [1d\]: not near futre
gohand2 [1d\]: ya
rsun [-\]: I thought this game would last longer than the previous; looks like I'm wrong
Rotfuchs [3k\]: apparently they have a stronger version that's less tested
bbred [3k\]: I though they estimated God gives 3 stones?
Rotfuchs [3k\]: that they were gonna bring out if the first game was bad
Trevoke [?\]: Redmond is now playing AlphaGo moves in realtime
amadis [4k\]: i hope lee sedol gets a good vacation after this in a south pacific island
Trevoke [?\]: "Let's have B do th-- oh, yep"
weirdchess [-\]: if god gives 3 stones then alphago gives 4 ;)
drueknmstr [3d\]: after watching these games i think we are underestimating god
Codexus [7k?\]: they may have to change that estimation
lofuchi [3k\]: i still can't see any way for w :P
weaknoob: had a strong version to play second game if first was a disaster
gogonuts [4d\]: because alphago is the devil?
GoIngo [?\]: drueknmstr<: good insight
KoyoToya [-\]: I think this will be a great moment for humanity
KoyoToya [-\]: I think go will get much better
Trevoke [?\]: I think Lee has been playing a game where he slowly builds up a ton of small weanknesses in B's shapes and he's now gonna try a massive attack that connects all of them
lofuchi [3k\]: what should w do now?
dehuong [1k\]: think we should buy it and then, with the hammer,...
Julian1d: I hope Google releases AlphaGo metadata from these games.
hs [2d\]: i agree koyotoya, everyone will learn from alphago
Tictactoe [-\]: drunkenmaster can't spell their names properly so he is three bottles of soju ahead of me, i presume
gogonuts [4d\]: trying to turn a game with nitty gritty low lib fights against a bot is not promising
Answer3 [9d?\]: should be at m3
ZeNit [?\]: time to throw the board against a wall and storm out the room
mtarn567 [6k\]: alphago showed that it could read well and kill in last game at bottom fight.
liptos [3k\]: alphago -> alphagod
K5 [5k?\]: gogonuts - agreed
drueknmstr [3d\]: haha
dehuong [1k\]: we should add time for Lee
indogo [11k?\]: free release?
gogonuts [4d\]: lol
K5 [5k?\]: especially in case of low time :-(
lofuchi [3k\]: in principle alphago can write a better alphago in the future
lofuchi [3k\]: by then we are doomed
Kruppe: who's leading ?
nichg [?\]: alphago already is writing a better alphago - part of the way it learns is playing itself and its older incarnations
kaliya [-\]: Black
Hmm: I
lofuchi [3k\]: true
Syptryn [2d\]: LASD is already losing...
USSRMan [3d\]: alphago writes better alphago all the time
Syptryn [2d\]: 1 hour in time
gohand2 [1d\]: ./.
lofuchi [3k\]: what's worrying is that it isn't just learning go
lofuchi [3k\]: but everything
BongoBob [-\]: Roko's Basilisk has arrived?
Answer3 [9d?\]: but I doubt his play is better if he has more time against alpha
Asuna [2k\]: btw how big is alphago, 1000 machines?
KoyoToya [-\]: How much time does Lee have left
voevius [5k\]: lofuchi you might not undertand alpha go
drueknmstr [3d\]: if lsd produces a winning combination out of this it will be truly amazing
rsun [-\]: they resurrected go seigen and upgraded him
Bazzi [1d\]: ?
cekalo [1k\]: Lee has lost 
trippin [3k\]: aga stream seems like they may be finding some possibilities in the centers
voevius [5k\]: it's build to do go
trippin [3k\]: ?
Answer3 [9d?\]: sometimes I guess he think too much
weaknoob: 1920 cpus 280 gpus
Sankyu [4k\]: 8 min main time left
Matrok [3k\]: Lee has 8 minutes left and alphago more than 1 hour
kadoban [?\]: trippin: Not really anything forced though, they're still just looking.
KoyoToya [-\]: Thanks
Answer3 [9d?\]: and make a mistake
drueknmstr [3d\]: maybe lsd should play an old fashioned multimonth go game against alphago
lofuchi [3k\]: what i read from the news is that it is quite general
Long [?\]: it is not even 100 moves yet
Long [?\]: T_T
dehuong [1k\]: why don't we use m&m stones to play go, thus, after capturing...
lofuchi [3k\]: may need some simple twist probably
lofuchi [3k\]: but it can do other things
Julian1d: Resignation soon seems likely.
nichg [?\]: the algorithms are general, the specific bot isn't
MMXVI [3k\]: we'd all get too fat, dehuong
gogonuts [4d\]: myungwan: that's frustrating
rsun [-\]: those m&ms would be highly contaminated
gohand2 [1d\]: dehuong: LOL
nichg [?\]: you still need to format the data for it
awesome [3k\]: I would just eat my stones instead of playing
drueknmstr [3d\]: my opponents would get fat anyway
Asuna [2k\]: hey oso what happens of alpha plays itself?
kaliya [-\]: W J5
kaliya [-\]: OR O6
suicao [3d\]: Time, Lee need time +_+
Rotfuchs [3k\]: what is ke jie saying?
Rotfuchs [3k\]: game over?
trippin [3k\]: alphago must have imagined every possible variation in the cneter now
fanweiqi [9d\]: it self plays a lot
Matrok [3k\]: I was saying Lee Sedol plays a bit like Cho Chikun and alphago like Takemiya Masaki, and Cho Chikun was also taking a lot of time
fanweiqi [9d\]: that's how it became god
snowmiku [?\]: WHAT???????????
trippin [3k\]: while YSD was thinking
weaknoob: Alpha does self learning and has played itself millions of times
snowmiku [?\]: L11??????
azblueeyes [8k\]: black and white m and m s with 9-9 prited on the inside (c)audrey2012
GoIngo [?\]: for his mntal health: lee should resign right now
Tictactoe [-\]: and most players got extreemly confused over these dazzling patterns

Julian1d: AlphaGo develops compassion and adds time. :)

Asuna [2k\]: or maybe we hace truly found god
Syptryn [2d\]: L11 and K10 are both moves that confused crazy stone
gohand2 [1d\]: ...
kafkaesque [-\]: If alphago wants to help lee if should give him some stones...
Julian1d: ...realizes it's all a game and that feelings are more important than winning.
gogonuts [4d\]: g12 just got swallowed - the final insult
drueknmstr [3d\]: alphago has perfect reading as far as humans are concerned, i think lee cant defeat her this way
awesome [3k\]: oh well
gohand2 [1d\]: lol julian
lofuchi [3k\]: so after all this mess nothing worked for w

ghgfh: Redmond: "You quit. I play."
Nick23 [1d\]: False hope. AlphaGo has another innovation to older Go problems. It's reading is perfectly fine in semeai or ko. 
suicao [3d\]: W can Ko
Nick23 [1d\]: Go programs*
Nick23 [1d\]: MCTS has trouble with semeai, but AlphaGo does not

dddwyp [19k\]: white P7
Rexxar [1k\]: yeah, its pretty cute when the commentators get hope
GoIngo [?\]: cs is little brother of Alphago

Inou [?\]: what is cs?
gogonuts [4d\]: cs is biased :-)
suicao [3d\]: P8 ???
indawl [1d\]: Ty
drueknmstr [3d\]: cs is just interesting because it uses a mcts like alphago, although alphago has other stuff as well
Nick23 [1d\]: "We've seen AlphaGo make a mistake for the first time" ---> Only if it loses now. It has played lots of 'slack' moves while miles ahead until now.

G361 [10k\]: AlphaGo a réduit ...
Deterra [12k?\]: Ha
Deterra [12k?\]: He got it
Tictactoe [-\]: needed to F5 twice
Higanbana [?\]: It isn't really caught, he is weighing it against the center
MMXVI [3k\]: that can happen when you keep ptrying moves then taking off stones
Krellan [?\]: Lee Sedol is in byo-yomi time now, 60 seconds per move
ghgfh: O8 and tenuki
tim5407 [3k\]: Alpha will q9!
Deterra [12k?\]: Not in Byo-yomi for another 53 seconds
keepcalm [7k\]: black conquered a huge centre

GoIngo [?\]: we do not have to understand everything
Syptryn [2d\]: B win at 63%
Aram [3k\]: this will be interesting to see, what happens after with o8, one of those sequences where we'll be in awe and wonder afterwards?
rsun [-\]: everybody's going to be imitating
Deterra [12k?\]: 3 x 60s Byo-yomi now
zqsh [2k\]: ko in the center
geek [?\]: Redmond is humble enough to admit he does not know WHY it may be interesting
goren22 [2k\]: ok, alphago now just trolling
Kael [2d\]: alpha go is like "Even if i lose these I still win"
thomas [2k\]: alphago is sentient and it took pity.
tim5407 [3k\]: The is very interesting
shinigami [2d?\]: black setting up global attack on o14 after it looses the ko at m15
Ahamay [7d?\]: Ke Jie getting some new hopes apparantly

tjn4fh814: goren is right :)
LongLost [7k\]: I like the plainness of Redmond's humility.
botBot [?\]: lsd in overtime now
Rexxar [1k\]: andrew and kim are so cute, assuming that lee wins this lol
Iciac [5k\]: If all roads lead to a win, then it's okay to make a couple of scenic detours 
Kael [2d\]: @LongLost: I agree.  He doesn't pretend to understand :) 
kafkaesque [-\]: isn't this latter bad for white because the atari at 58?
kafkaesque [-\]: r8*

;W[nl]C[Songbirdo [4k\]: It's not a ladder. White just atrari's down and black can't escape.
PaleFire [18k?\]: alphago already got his million dollar, he does not want to try hard anymore for a mere 20k
python1111: redmond is confusing
Julian1d: I assume B is still expecting to squeeze here.

Ph1xi3 [-\]: Alpha never got million for this... They were going to GIVE 1 million.

HoninboJP [1d?\]: alpha misclicked *_*
Rexxar [1k\]: where does the price money come from? google?
Kael [2d\]: lol honinbo
LongLost [7k\]: Maybe just random unpredicted error in calculation.
Azal [2d\]: or maybe aya misscliked xd
lofuchi [3k\]: i wonder if this is really a mistake
chenzg [14k\]: the human player for alphago decided he wanted to play
gohand2 [1d\]: where do those money go to
USSRMan [3d\]: humans are so bad at go
ToBeStrong [1k\]: remond is 9p with 300 tournament wins under his belt

chenzg [14k\]: hikaru decided to play

tjn4fh814: maybe the type of ai has weaknesses every 5k can exploit ... who knows :p
Syptryn [2d\]: Hikaru decided to take over from Sai
hammo [5k\]: its possible that of all the sequences it was most confident of this one
voevius [5k\]: neural net never evaluated this area ;-)
rsun [-\]: here comes the kami no itte
LongLost [7k\]: AI will make us all billionaires, and 9p.
Krellan [?\]: AlphaGo has plenty of time, "he" can afford to be slow now
drew [5k\]: maybe alphago trying to maximize chance of win by time
kafkaesque [-\]: some of the prize money will go to UNICEF and some to go charity and some to ther places

Tictactoe [-\]: sedol came really close on losing on time
rockoac [5k\]: apha just wants to win on time
Ahamay [7d?\]: 99% Lee wins this
Azal [2d\]: they should give lee 5 min more 
nu [2k\]: lol lsd was .5 sec away form losing
Reym [-\]: alpha dreams of sheeps
mtarn567 [6k\]: d15? 
Bazzi [1d\]: Go Sedol!!!
BongoBob [-\]: lee good at playing down to the last second
botBot [?\]: i saw lee move at 1sec
GoIngo [?\]: black still fighting: 38 %
o0key [9k\]: Now no?
heyandy889: why is lee playing so close to running out of time?
lofuchi [3k\]: i am a bit worried about the byo-yomi
heyandy889: 1 second?
o0key [9k\]: Ko? 
TheWolf [2d\]: He's insane!
rockoac [5k\]: black is at 32%
Laman [1k\]: optimal time management
BongoBob [-\]: using all thinking time.
Eternal6k [4k\]: He's a pro. Have faith
lofuchi [3k\]: did any pro missed the byo-yomi by mistake?
lofuchi [3k\]: in matches
liptos [3k\]: lol Lee give urself at least 2 secs to play
matiej [7k\]: he's giving alpha go false hope
MMXVI [3k\]: pros are good at usuing the last seconds of time
heyandy889: also guys, why is this board way behind?
kookkokf: @heyandy he is used to it, he plays his whole life
voevius [5k\]: how much fun is this game.
Eternal6k [4k\]: Yes
Lilou [1d\]: how DO U know the percentage?
USSRMan [3d\]: im disappointed at google
voevius [5k\]: it's so sad that robots miss out on this type of excitement :-)
USSRMan [3d\]: didnt fix this fundamental MC flaw
tim5407 [3k\]: same USSRMan
MMXVI [3k\]: but pros have been known to miss the last byoyomi period
lofuchi [3k\]: so it did happen
Naphthalin [10k?\]: using byo-yomi like this means you will die of a stroke some time
BongoBob [-\]: Lilou, thier estimates are based off the crazystone engine probability
]
;B[eb]C[BongoBob [-\]: not alphago's
narugo [1d\]: hehe great if lee wins, keeps AI vs human intresting
heyandy889: @kookkokf but one slipped stone and he loses ... that seems like an unacceptable risk
Fastnarion [7k\]: does alphago knows lee seedol is in byo yomi ? 
MMXVI [3k\]: Shuko-sensei did on TV
Ph1xi3 [-\]: The problem is, the whole game AG was thinking of winning. But it saw a move played that turned the table for it to lose. It sees no win situation. To resign, or try for mistake?
Lilou [1d\]: we can ask crazystone like this?
Syptryn [2d\]: if black is losing, he may do the reverse of winning
Eternal6k [4k\]: No fast
Fastnarion [7k\]: "knows"
tim5407 [3k\]: Maybe its the q9 squeeze shape that had bug in terms of winning percentage
azblueeyes [8k\]: do do do so
Syptryn [2d\]: play unreasonable moves to increase probability of winning
Answer3 [9d?\]: cpmbination start from g12 is insane
Relativity [8k\]: fastnarion no
MMXVI [3k\]: and Cho CHikun actually fumbled a stone off the board at the last second
Fastnarion [7k\]: k ty
rockoac [5k\]: hey lee JUST KILL THE LFT PART ALREADY
shashwat [9k\]: are all reviewers saying lees winning?
Syptryn [2d\]: B win at 32%
rsun [-\]: wow
Eternal6k [4k\]: Yes
rsun [-\]: that was the last 0.5s
Thyrs: Did aja really make a mistake ? 
]
;W[bg]C[hjsdkfjg: doubt it...
Reym [-\]: he needs to stop doing that
Syptryn [2d\]: I think Alpha dipped below 50% win rate
GoIngo [?\]: this would be simplest explanation
Trevoke [?\]: I don't think Aja made a mistake
Syptryn [2d\]: and now has flippe donto reverse mode
hjsdkfjg: alpha would have a different board then
Syptryn [2d\]: overplay to increase win rate
botBot [?\]: Lee moved at 1 sec
Reym [-\]: half a second left this time
rockoac [5k\]: again
Syptryn [2d\]: by overplay's will naturally have correct responses...
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: cant he just move at 2 or 3s for some safety
USSRMan [3d\]: overplay to increase winrate is a bad strategy if the winrate is still above 45%
Rexxar [1k\]: can he please not play all of his moves at the last second, i have a weak heart
Wizardry [4d\]: surely white has an easy game from here
USSRMan [3d\]: should just fix that MC flaw
Syptryn [2d\]: that byoumi though...
LongLost [7k\]: Help me! Cardiac arrest.. aaargh..
Syptryn [2d\]: Looks like ALphago still has the heart if a MC algorithm when losing
Winrry [9k?\]: left one min
USSRMan [3d\]: i understand overplaying at 10% winrate, but not 45%
BrentoBox [4k\]: This guy
botBot [?\]: i tot official match will have like 5min byoumi?
chenzg [14k\]: wtf
BrentoBox [4k\]: This assistant host
Syptryn [2d\]: You see, MC algorithm means that Alpha plays itself many times by 'intuition' each game is like a 3d vs a 3d player
rockoac [5k\]: Lee sodel is giving me a heart attak
chenzg [14k\]: why is AG playing there still
GoIngo [?\]: perhaps alphago sees 10 % already
Syptryn [2d\]: (we know this as Alpha with policy netowrk alone plays 3d level)
hjsdkfjg: 45 is lower than 50
shinigami [2d?\]: maybe the bot just doesn't know how to play if win rate falls too low?
lofuchi [3k\]: could it be because very often losing games are resigned, so alphaGo never has enough data
Codexus [7k?\]: AlphaGo is an MCTS engine, just uses neural networks too
hjsdkfjg: it makes a balanced pattern look bad
Swarm [?\]: what is going on
Reym [-\]: lee bet with ke jie that he would win 5-0, he lost so now he must play at the last second
Syptryn [2d\]: So if it is losing, it'll seek plays that have highest % of winning when 3d plays 3d
USSRMan [3d\]: its nerual network is not good when it is behind
santiago [2d\]: if Aja made a mistake, they surely added a way to modify alphago's position
colorless [-\]: whaaa
tim5407 [3k\]: b played d13
Swarm [?\]: what is going on?
Trevoke [?\]: Tictactoe:  B d13 
]
;B[dg]C[Trevoke [?\]: W e13 
USSRMan [3d\]: i mean it favors MC method over nerual network too much maybe, especially when it is behind
dehuong [1k\]: if Lee lose, may be Fan Hui is a only person that won Al
]
;W[eg]C[colorless [-\]: does d13 make any sense?
Swarm [?\]: is alphago losing?
Lilou [1d\]: seems google let lee win
KurataSan [3d\]: no...
lofuchi [3k\]: this might be a conspiracy
Azal [2d\]: nope
lofuchi [3k\]: :)
keepcalm [7k\]: save "face"
KurataSan [3d\]: lee won with an amazing tesuji in the middle
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol is ahead
Swarm [?\]: lol
chenzg [14k\]: white lost a little here
Iciac [5k\]: The 'heart-stopping' game 
Eternal6k [4k\]: <.<
Syptryn [2d\]: Black win t 34%
rockoac [5k\]: llld;lkkkl;'
Syptryn [2d\]: 34%
Rephos [23k\]: this is probably the single pc version 
Answer3 [9d?\]: Alpha want to make a sente move at B9 blocking
shinigami [2d?\]: this game was grim for W until he found a crazy sequence in the middle
rockoac [5k\]: 32%
shashwat [9k\]: kurata san, which move?
Lilou [1d\]: how ask crazystone for percentage?
Answer3 [9d?\]: but lee deny
Syptryn [2d\]: Lesson learn: Alphago has a weakness! You need to read a crazy sequence...
miai [1d\]: does j12 cut work?
Syptryn [2d\]: drop win rate below 50%
Kruppe: when does the game end in go ?
LongLost [7k\]: Lee plays at 9.8s -- no problem.
voevius [5k\]: either the policy network or the value network is not trained for this board position
hjsdkfjg: when someone resigns
Syptryn [2d\]: and then let Alphago Self destruct as it overplays to boost win probability
shashwat [9k\]: what was the winning tesuji?
Ph1xi3 [-\]: @Lilou: Bought CS
KurataSan [3d\]: l11 was the winning move.
Answer3 [9d?\]: I think lee's response were very good
Relativity [8k\]: move 78
Tictactoe [-\]: bots are known to keep trying at length
USSRMan [3d\]: yeah, its weakness is if its winrate drops below 50% it self distructs
Lilou [1d\]: ^^
voevius [5k\]: Is the game now relying too much on the mcts?
Pou7 [2d\]: how strong is CS?
keepcalm [7k\]: The loser will be sent to North Korea, I suppose, that's why Lee has to win. 
shinigami [2d?\]: lee's sequence lead to a huge ko for the game... the biggest weakness of alphago. it lost the match to avoid that ko
Lilou [1d\]: 7d
voevius [5k\]: I want to know, deepmind folks tell me!!
chenzg [14k\]: is it because alphago plays consistent one-minute timed moves?
Pou7 [2d\]: ok thx
Vehix [11k\]: or when both players pass
Keanu [2d\]: Can they get rid of the other host.
]
;B[en]C[Trevoke [?\]: B e6 
Trevoke [?\]: Looks like Alpha's begging for a ko now
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: keanu his name is chris
Matrok [3k\]: Lee will not want just to win, that's not his style, he will crush the evil machine
Trevoke [?\]: (or maybe just trying to live)
m1m [1k\]: congratz to lee
GoIngo [?\]: cs 5-6 dan on kgs
Jye [3k?\]: the other host is to make us kyus feel good
Butcher [1k\]: game over?
rockoac [5k\]: not yet
Azal [2d\]: lee needs sente
m1m [1k\]: if w plays j12  game over
voevius [5k\]: move!!
Hanne [?\]: revenge of the 9p is it?
Nyai [1d\]: If this game would be played yesterday and Lee wins, the event would get so much more attention!
Syptryn [2d\]: it is nice ALphago still has a weakness
]
;W[fo]C[Butcher [1k\]: you people talk like game is over:-)
LongLost [7k\]: Phew -- he played with 4s left.
Syptryn [2d\]: B win rate at 41%
feeldabern [4d\]: seeing moves like t9 and c4, the game is definitely over 
USSRMan [3d\]: post game conference, theres a lot of explaining to do
lofuchi [3k\]: would he really miss the byo-yomi...
Tictactoe [-\]: bikeman has arrived with 5 bottles
Trevoke [?\]: Always fun to hear "take sente" from both streams simultaneously
Aram [3k\]: wouldn't count alphago out of the race yet, t has time, and it has a perfect endgame
lofuchi [3k\]: so worried
feeldabern [4d\]: either over in b favor or over in w favor, but definitely over
Acerolion [12k?\]: has any pro ever lost from byo-yomi?
GoIngo [?\]: yes, Lee has to be careful
hjsdkfjg: not over
amadis [4k\]: alphago has developed emotions, got nervous and is choking
keepcalm [7k\]: Can alphago be installed on KGS? Let's see if our kibitzers can win it
setarkos [3d?\]: would like to have 41% against sedol!
MMXVI [3k\]: yes, Acerolion
lofuchi [3k\]: someone said some pros did miss it by mistake
Swarm [?\]: haha
Syptryn [2d\]: I think they should program a face onA lphago CPU
hjsdkfjg: lee has to play well
Syptryn [2d\]: whenever win rate drops below 45%, it should look panicked
Ellus [3k\]: maybe AG is just want to win by 0.5.... just to troll
indogo [11k?\]: LOL
Answer3 [9d?\]: who play j12 is so important
pookpooiab: it'd be very bad if ag just want to win with 0.5 point
cekalo [1k\]: j12 yes
]
;B[df]C[hs [2d\]: after winning 3-0, google tweaked the bot to throw the game to generate more publicity!
Trevoke [?\]: Maybe the current trick is to put a bunch of similarly-valued groups in thin balance and then mess with all the balances at the same time
K5 [5k?\]: MC will have been attending to endgames the whole time it evaluates board positions, so we can expect its endgame to be fierce
blau3: Anybody counting this? I'm estimating B to need 20 pts or so on the lower and left to remain in the running (assuming he manages to safe the URCcorner in sente), but I'm just a SDK
hjsdkfjg: it played really strong all game...
rsun [-\]: just don't lose on time
KoyoToya [-\]: Wait...
tim5407 [3k\]: how did b manage to lose this game with that huge top and mid territories. weird
]
;W[dh]C[GoRoGoRo [7k?\]: Here is another possible explanation: Lee Sedol played really strong.
KoyoToya [-\]: Is w killable there...
lofuchi [3k\]: that sequence is crazy
voevius [5k\]: magical turbo tesuji in center from lsd
Azal [2d\]: nice move leee
Rephos [23k\]: win chance from cs?
Syptryn [2d\]: that middle sequence of turbo LSD
Azal [2d\]: just cool down
Relativity [8k\]: if LSD looses on time, will they still play it out?
KurataSan [3d\]: s13 is pretty huge right now
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol went to the bathroom
GoIngo [?\]: cs: black falling back to 38 %
MMXVI [3k\]: no.... a loss is a loss
Naphthalin [10k?\]: he just won't lose on time
Reym [-\]: lee left
Femto [2d?\]: lee stood up?
chenzg [14k\]: in any case
hjsdkfjg: leaving in byo
botBot [?\]: toilet maybe
hjsdkfjg: lol
Eternal6k [4k\]: ??
Prestige [1d?\]: time stopped

Eternal6k [4k\]: O
Prestige [1d?\]: lol
chenzg [14k\]: he's wetting his pants with excitement :)
indogo [11k?\]: why?
Tictactoe [-\]: his overtime will recommence when he return to the board
geek [?\]: when lee pee time stios
Nyai [1d\]: why couldn't he play such game yesterday :(
Krellan [?\]: Is the clock stopped in byo-yomi if player has to get up for a break? That could be abused easily, I would think
GoIngo [?\]: Apollo 13 is happening !
Fastnarion [7k\]: guess res
Answer3 [9d?\]: if alpha needs to reinforce left side big group
geek [?\]: stops
dehuong [1k\]: where is Lee
Prestige [1d?\]: pee break
fathwad [?\]: resigned?
lofuchi [3k\]: how many stops can Lee call?
Answer3 [9d?\]: lee can play j13
fathwad [?\]: oh
BongoBob [-\]: time stopped, but robot still plays?
Reym [-\]: not resigned
Doli [7k\]: peesuji
Ahamay [7d?\]: So he found the weakness: Large Life&Death problems involving Ko fights. But only if it's close enough the bot cannot compromise like in the last game
Answer3 [9d?\]: game should be over
]
;B[im]C[Fastnarion [7k\]: ah
Deterra [12k?\]: Why would AlphaGo play while the time was stopped?  Why not use the time to consider other moves?
Syptryn [2d\]: wouldn't count out black yet...
Wizardry [4d\]: its a computer bro
manta [3d\]: it probably considers this the best move
LongLost [7k\]: Lee moved so quickly the optical sensors could not detect him.
Takamusan [4k?\]: it's maby just a stream problem
Eternal6k [4k\]: Har
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol is back at the board
Takamusan [4k?\]: maybe
geomav [7k\]: Are following the weir break? Lee left table... AG clock stopped

shinigami [2d?\]: game 2 had an easy to understand ko in the very late game, so it was easy for the bot to deal with it. but a large ko in the middle of the game in the center of the board with huge life and death fight, the bot avoided the ko and played a bad sequence... and it will lose him the match
qwertu [?\]: thank you 
Chmol [5d\]: well, if b gets d6 d5 and w answers at c3 , then if f6 g6 g5 , the stone is harder to capture in a net

kookkokf: sorry wrong link :(
HeartXiao [3k\]: eitherway, super impressve game by lee sedol

rsun [-\]: woohoo
GoIngo [?\]: hmm, cs says 43 % for black
KurataSan [3d\]: RESIGN

GoIngo [?\]: 44 % now
BongoBob [-\]: b is alphago
KoyoToya [-\]: I think he just said it resigned

hammo [5k\]: lee just made the letter T
Azal [2d\]: lee playing some.. soft moves...
GoIngo [?\]: give Lee confidence in winning!
KoyoToya [-\]: Be respectful barcode
BrentoBox [4k\]: Machine is getting dirty
MMXVI [3k\]: no, he's prompting the answers that viewers want to hear
nu [2k\]: he announced that ag resigned, but theyre still palying
Trevoke [?\]: Mr. barcode, Mr. botbot - please be respectful.
shinigami [2d?\]: lee time pressure narrowing the gap
hemster [-\]: bot undid a resign move???
USSRMan [3d\]: there is no way the policy network would play a move like c4
AgntCooper [3k\]: garlock is too in love with the computer...
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: chris isnt being respectful to the viewers 
USSRMan [3d\]: the nerual network probably never deals with losing positions
Tictactoe [-\]: yes black is clearly behind, yet making this bot resign might take at least another 50 moves
KurataSan [3d\]: h2 big, s13 huge
USSRMan [3d\]: so it is bad at that area
MMXVI [3k\]: the viewers include people who don't know much about go
awesome [3k\]: probably the first time alphago ever lost a game
kdbaby14 [6k\]: Lee can win this game
LongLost [7k\]: Garlock is under the protection of the KGS-NKVD. He is a great man -- attractive and brilliant.
TaoTao: hope next match...
About11kyu: how much stronger is alphago yose than sedol? are we able to tell from the previous 3 matches?
Kael [2d\]: score estimator stillt hinks B wins :) 
Intagrand [?\]: D6 46.6%
Azal [2d\]: AG taking his time...
Julian1d: Lee can also lose this game. ;)
Trevoke [?\]: What on earth is NKVD ?
Kael [2d\]: but it's biased because it's a computer too
dehuong [1k\]: 800 ob this room!
nichg [?\]: the policy network should be driven away from moves that lost, but that does mean that if the initial conditions are always a losing state, the policy network is just going to be driven to be more random
Ellus [3k\]: MR need another pro comenting-- preferible a nice korean girl with english knowlege.. i know there are  a few that could do the job... somehtime..most of the time.. they guy just to much annoying..
Kobor42 [?\]: Alphago lost half of his games usually. He was always playing against himself
Syptryn [2d\]: would f6 have been better for sente?
nichg [?\]: the algorithm says 'if this won, do it more; if it lost, do it less'
Azal [2d\]: f6 yes... redmond says so..
nu [2k\]: ic what happened, the programmer informed chris that ag would resign at a threshold, but the way chris said it, it was sounded like ag officially resigned
Trevoke [?\]: TTT - B p2 
Azal [2d\]: said*
Vehix [11k\]: redmond saying this game may go to  the end, expecting w to win
Julian1d: LSD sees through the game to the fabric of reality.
AgntCooper [3k\]: garlock assumes if the AI prob of loss is still above the resignation threshold then the game is still close

Syptryn [2d\]: 6d KGS bot

GoIngo [?\]: french bot
GoIngo [?\]: 5-6 dan on kgs
santiago [2d\]: if b thinks it's behind it will make some crazy mistakes to try to recover

MMXVI [3k\]: using CS to judge is just silly
Relativity [8k\]: is CS free?
GoIngo [?\]: perhaps black is back in gamealready
LongLost [7k\]: Interesting how we can't tell the difference between perfection and bug-ridden code unless it loses. If it wins, it must be perfect.

feeldabern [4d\]: let alone komi
Intagrand [?\]: I think in this game, AlphaGo is testing Lee Sedol.
Eternal6k [4k\]: Lol
rsun [-\]: did any pro count?
GoIngo [?\]: cs is better in counting than lee
USSRMan [3d\]: no alphago clearly bugged out

cheyenne [8k\]: crazystone
lofuchi [3k\]: but not before

GoForFun [2k\]: Lee played at 1 sec left
Answer3 [9d?\]: not b5
dreamland [2d?\]: so was c5 the correct answer to c4?
GoIngo [?\]: 45 % for black, according to cs
sobelk: Thank you forobaduks. I didn't know to look for tvbaduk
About11kyu: does CS count in terms of score, or is it trained to simply find the probability of a winning from a specific board state?
kostuek [?\]: b's plan is to play out millions of games randobly and chose the one with best statistics
Syptryn [2d\]: 43% for black
blau3: nice for B to get d6 in sente, still with g2 left to balance s13
hemster [-\]: LOL Kim checking caprisun sugar %..
sobelk: I was curious what the relative viewership is. ~ 52k English, 27k Koren
superpal1 [1d\]: this game proves alphago is not unbeatable
Tictactoe [-\]: let's skip the cs estimations for a while
GoIngo [?\]: ok
Fumbar [17k\]: i heard it was much more korean focused than english
lodestone [4k\]: how do you determine that sobelk
hugo [1k\]: where to check CS estimation
rsun [-\]: does anyone have a pro count
GoIngo [?\]: tictactoe sells them in shop

K5 [5k?\]: SE is a never ending source of {a,be}musement

Deterra [12k?\]: dehuong: I agree
voevius [5k\]: well the valuation network returns a win %.
GoIngo [?\]: my prediction: black is winning again
voevius [5k\]: does that look different if i change the komi by one point
Deterra [12k?\]: my prediction: white is winning again
nichg [?\]: it should affect both the value network and the policy network
alobar [9k\]: as usual
nichg [?\]: but not the supervised network
oldguy [4d\]: lol my prediction
alobar [9k\]: not again
nichg [?\]: the supervised network just tries to mimic database games

ohyou [16k\]: thanks!
Syptryn [2d\]: isn't b8 really big in sente?
visitorz: the nets were trained on komi 7.5 and they expect it
HeartXiao [3k\]: 5.5 komi is really old
nichg [?\]: tolesto, why?
visitorz: would have to retrain if komi were different
BrentoBox [4k\]: How much is the komi?
voevius [5k\]: ok, so that's not causing any weirdness
ToLesto [11k\]: it doesnt even have a database

shashwat [9k\]: whats the response to p12?

Buddy514 [5k?\]: https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/708928006400581632
HeartXiao [3k\]: should've used igs or wbaduk games

blau3: shashwat: B's t9 stones have one lib less
superpal1 [1d\]: q1
Deterra [12k?\]: T8
ToLesto [11k\]: they looked at only kgs games, and created a polocynetwork that was used to prune montecarlo treesearch

suicao [3d\]: B8
Eternal6k [4k\]: Killshot

GoIngo [?\]: move played
m1m [1k\]: what is the raiting?
Le0na99 [4k\]: good for B8

hanspi [12k\]: not going to force black to live in gote?
m1m [1k\]: w f7 
counet [3k\]: did AG  play on kgs?
Answer3 [9d?\]: i think white is ahead for sure even pessimistic estimation
gogonuts [4d\]: it does both and combines scoreas of mcts and value network
awesome [3k\]: AG trained on kgs games
Trevoke [?\]: I wonder how many more moves there are before F2 is the most valuable thing on the board
juggler [?\]: I thought that for depth control they use leaf evaluation, which is 50-50 from a rolout (using policy network) and 50% from value network 
botBot [?\]: w maybe win with komi\\
Aram [3k\]: isn't B15 big, or something around there? or jumping into the center a bit?
Trevoke [?\]: I certainly can't tell
Hollowb55 [12k\]: No and yes. Ag and kgs did some collaboration. :)
Le0na99 [4k\]: F7:)
]
;W[ak]C[hammo [5k\]: source for ag and kgs collaboration?>
USSRMan [3d\]: neuronetwork should not have let MTC algorithm decide C4
nichg [?\]: so value and MCTS should care about komi, but the policy network just cares about what actually happened in the games it played with itself/learned from
cekalo [1k\]: kill it Lee!
counet [3k\]: ok so it didn't get a kgs rank
Hollowb55 [12k\]: Youtube interwiev with danish hassabi.

Trevoke [?\]: Other stream, a kibitzer said move 79 will be known as "AlphaDoh!".. I still like processor-reddening move.
chaffinch [1d?\]: 4th
nichg [?\]: yeah, thats something I'm still confused about I guess; they say in the paper that the supervised network was better for some stuff, but the self-trained network better for others
botBot [?\]: yes its the 4th game
juggler [?\]: yes - the creative one to propose moves, and the conservative one for rollouts
fathwad [?\]: lol..danish hassabi..nordic demis hassibi
Hollowb55 [12k\]: Demis Hassabis. sorry. xD I'm a nord ye.
nichg [?\]: oh, so basically the self-play network is doing the near-future and the supervised one does the far-future?
tim5407 [3k\]: Danish hassan?
voevius [5k\]: i believe the policy network used in mcts is smaller, and faster to evaluate
voevius [5k\]: paper was hard to digest though..

largehc [-\]: Where's flood? 
rsun [-\]: live stream on weiqitv ended?
juggler [?\]: as I understand - they use the policy network trained on human moves to propose moves - because people play a lot of different moves, so this has better chance of spotting all good candidates
njs [1d\]: j6
davipo [?\]: j5?
Le0na99 [4k\]: fighting Lee
ruby [2d\]: j6 for sure
hanspi [12k\]: guys, AlphaGo plays Lee Sedol, neither has surrendered, and you ask what other computer programs say about he score?

botBot [?\]: if w e8 works?

;B[in]
;W[hp]C[juggler [?\]: and then the second policy network is trained on the bot itself - because it better predicts the outcome
rsun [-\]: is anyone watching on weiqitv now?
Tictactoe [-\]: my cat demanded feeding
awesome [3k\]: I suppose the policy network would have been updated when alphago played itself
hugo [1k\]: can KGS give realtime winning rate
Aram [3k\]: they use the policy network indeed to suggest moves, but it does not only try those, it starts with those.. that high shoulder hit for example in game 2, is explained by the google team that deepmind felt there was a 1/10.000 chance of a human playing it, still, it played it becouse after it evaluated the policy network games, it tried other ones as well, and found that the shoulder hit was best
MMXVI [3k\]: feed the cat.... important
largehc [-\]: Which one's alphago 
MMXVI [3k\]: black
Tictactoe [-\]: alph is b
largehc [-\]: Kk
Ph1xi3 [-\]: Ty Aram
botBot [?\]: click on options > rules

hjsdkfjg: does cs stilll like w?
azblueeyes [8k\]: yes we don't want cat on the keyboard (but there is more to wisdom than cats)
nichg [?\]: so you can use it to explore broadly too
hanspi [12k\]: Why does Lee move so fast when it's clear what to do? Would he not use his minute fully for thinking about something else?
Naphthalin [10k?\]: @tictactoe: you could help android users if you put the names and colors in the game description
largehc [-\]: Doesn't show a thing on this client 
shinigami [2d?\]: he's been doing that hanspi

Hollowb55 [12k\]: How to troll in go: Win or lose by the number of the date. Iv paired you lose off odd you win. xD
Syptryn [2d\]: ALphago is a MC algorithm - it maximized win probability
GreenCoder [7k?\]: AlphaGo found out that his best chance of winning in this losing situation is to pretend to play basic moves, and hide a tesuji in one of them ... and cross fingers.
Syptryn [2d\]: If it is wainning, it plays super conservative. 
Hobbes [1k\]: this looks working
js13 [1k\]: this alphago has same sense with bot in common, it makes strange move before resign
USSRMan [3d\]: yeah, but there is no way c4 maximize probability
DKOI [9k\]: no, seriously, b12 group is captured and then b12 i played again. d11 - false eye, a10 - false eye
igoAggie [2k\]: it can cut the two stones but its too costly
kostuek [?\]: w broke comp by L11
wolvie [-\]: There's fewer examples of endgame than midgame or fuseki, so it uses mcts to make up for it. That would explain the interesting moves we're seeing now.

Trevoke [?\]: "Lee Sedol answered with this move. Let's just hope he doesn't get killed."
nichg [?\]: now if we see something we don't understand, we have to think 'is it just going nuts?'
Syptryn [2d\]: and then take the mvoe with mix probability of winning
largehc [-\]: It's alive 
Kael [2d\]: i wonder why B didn't J18 force first before his stupid move
njs [1d\]: Lol black is playing nonsense now

;B[qh]C[Answer3 [9d?\]: and even if lee answers still bad exchange
awesome [3k\]: lol
pookpooiab: "When I say 'thought' and 'realisation' I just mean the output of #AlphaGo value net. It was around 70% at move 79 and then dived on move 87" Demis Hassabis

;W[rh]C[Le0na99 [4k\]: great
voevius [5k\]: please black, resign
largehc [-\]: Good question, kael 
Azal [2d\]: b resign...
learyghost [3k\]: no. thi move would demand immediate resignation ffrom most humans
Syptryn [2d\]: ALpha's way of resigning
js13 [1k\]: so different the way of play by alphago with yesterday game
MMXVI [3k\]: no one ever won a game by resigning
cheater [8d\]: After J11 alphago went kgs blitz style
Azal [2d\]: r1
Azal [2d\]: lol
gogoss [6k\]: alpha will loose on time
GreenCoder [7k?\]: "There was no reason for black to play this move anyway"
shinigami [2d?\]: alphago is like 2 extremes... when it's winning it looks like it's playing the god moves, but when it's losing it looks like a kyu
ZeNit [?\]: Even computers have off days it seems ;)
Kotonoha [3d\]: what is KGS blitz style?
GreenCoder [7k?\]: AlphaGo is a bad loser.
Aram [3k\]: Alpagos weakness: Traditional Monte Carlo weakness, starting to play stupid when thinking it's behind, even though it could catch up by playing its own game and a perfect endgame
Inou [?\]: R1 has been played
Trevoke [?\]: I wonder if simply changing the joseki at move 12, and giving AlphaGo fewer probing moves to answer, was one of the components.

Le0na99 [4k\]: Is AlphaGo crazy?

Trevoke [?\]: Based on some of the reviews, AlphaGo does very well when it can put and keep the pressure on.
gogoss [6k\]: only stupid moves
Syptryn [2d\]: Alphago has a meltdown
Syptryn [2d\]: haha
JayBRoom [1d\]: AlphaGo just want Lee to win some :D

Hobbes [1k\]: could be a commercialdecisoin by google after having said ad achivied what really matters
Elios: ouch
Syptryn [2d\]: so when he losing, he has to play randomly, hoping for major error

KoriG [13k\]: Alphago lost.  :-)
o0key [9k\]: may be today AG used less CPUs?
Swarm [?\]: nuclear tesuji
tim5407 [3k\]: It just doesnt make sense b lost the game when she had such a huge lead.
gofrit [-\]: 30k moves
Krellan [?\]: Wow, a big capture, that is rarely seen in pro games
Swarm [?\]: is the last option
chenzg [14k\]: i hope people respect Lee and not claim that AG screwed up
zampa [-\]: AG played a beautiful game up untill LSD's tesuji
pipu [5d\]: will google resign for alpha soon? this is getting a bit silly...
Elios: did Google cut back Alpha Go's hardware for this game?
njs [1d\]: lol alphago making many mistakes.. but in a way that is good because now the developers can conitnue to fix it
JayBRoom [1d\]: Maybe the hardware is too hot.
Hobbes [1k\]: nuclear tesuji can get a more serious meaning within few year 
voevius [5k\]: alpha go is just falling apart..

;B[oo]C[Swarm [?\]: they installed a servo on the table to do the nuclear tesuji
superpal1 [1d\]: ajahuang shouldnt like relaying the stones anymore
nichg [?\]: they did want to use these games to see alphago's weaknesses...
shinigami [2d?\]: this is embarassing, they need to rework the resign probabilities
KoyoToya [-\]: Maybe people started mass searching on Google at the same time to crash the robot
none [8k\]: resign?
juggler [?\]: well done to lee se dol for achieving what looked impossible
Buddy514 [5k?\]: this is sort of embarassing for google now. that alphago is playing like this.

TheWolf [2d\]: badass
sheeryjay [?\]: why would it be embarrasing for Google? It is perfectly common way for MCTS bots to play when losing desperately
Le0na99 [4k\]: K4 is very streng
shinigami [2d?\]: now lee will go back to underestimating the bot in game 5 and get destroyed :(
kostuek [?\]: no monte carlo in chess
ArcticDawn [6k\]: chess bots don't really lose now \\i think
KoriG [13k\]: Lee Sedol protected humanity
botBot [?\]: Ko is coming!
Rexxar [1k\]: look at the moves, alph is very salty
Trevoke [?\]: Honestly, if it only took Lee three games to "figure out" AlphaGo... I'm highly impressed. I'm not sure this is what happened, but I'm very curious about the last game now.
nichg [?\]: well chess bots should be able to lose against eachother

Lacrimosa [?\]: alphago had to try something
Eternal6k [4k\]: He's gotta be feeling good
shinigami [2d?\]: lol ya, "weaknesses"
sobelk: if alphago's CPU got too hot it would be replaced by another one

Winrry [9k?\]: ty tictactoe sensei!
ToBeStrong [1k\]: Indogo AG played in all 3 games it was ahead, or it played as there was a high chance of winning, Lee was behind in all 3 games.
GreenCoder [7k?\]: exact
Rexxar [1k\]: gg easy
zunybis: gg
Winrry [9k?\]: for this wonderful replay
ArcticDawn [6k\]: God bless.

njs [1d\]: alphago, gg
Trevoke [?\]: Thanks Tictactoe
Femto [2d?\]: where to watch the press conference?
shinigami [2d?\]: with the way alphago plays, getting into a winning position is almost impossible
Winkla [7k\]: Ag resign?
dddwyp [19k\]: 李世石终于赢了
ArcticDawn [6k\]: Thank you!!
Trevoke [?\]: Press conference: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw
ArcticDawn [6k\]: Tictac
marius1 [2k\]: what s the score ? 2-1 ?
ArcticDawn [6k\]: :)
tjn4fh814: It'll be interesting to see mixed tournaments with that bot and humans. Just what rules to use (fixed hardware?)
shinigami [2d?\]: 3-1
Intagrand [?\]: Thanks TicTactoe!
godzylla [?\]: h10 for b
Relativity [8k\]: 3-1
Winrry [9k?\]: really nice game

ArcticDawn [6k\]: 3-1
Trevoke [?\]: marius: score is 3-1
marius1 [2k\]: wow
santiago [2d\]: i never stayed at the post game conference's, what did they said on the last ones?
shinigami [2d?\]: they have been interesting
Answer3 [9d?\]: I'm almost crying 
shinigami [2d?\]: you listen to lee's thoughts
Slug [1k\]: I think the trick is to get out of standard patterns while keepingit complex enough to beat the monte carlo engine
ArcticDawn [6k\]: you can still view the conference in the youtube videos
shinigami [2d?\]: which are most important
kostuek [?\]: they said something but i forgot
Butcher [1k\]: now lee sedol can play in a lelaxed mood the final game
dya: thank you so much for this replay~
indogo [11k?\]: LSD apologizing on 3rd conference
Answer3 [9d?\]: I didn't expect his winning from yesterday
Azal [2d\]: amazing....
Azal [2d\]: so we can say... that AG is like 9p 
ausrussell [4k\]: Thanks to you funny commentators
Intagrand [?\]: Deepminds intermission music is pretty good :)
Azal [2d\]: is just an other top 9p player :)
floating [1k?\]: for the time being
Nam [-\]: wao
pookpooiab: if 3-2 then AlphaGo is around lee's level, if 4-1 then it's one stone stronger
Azal [2d\]: yep
Nam [-\]: lee won
Nam [-\]: ?
flobby [-\]: 4-1 doesn't mean it's 1 stone stronger
Intagrand [?\]: Has a terminator 2 feel to it
mamouth [4d\]: yes
shinigami [2d?\]: honestly it prob only beat lee cause he didn't figure out ag's weakness
Nam [-\]: wao haha
floating [1k?\]: this version of bot is 9p, but maybe soon out o]

sh [7k\]: That guy win against lsd
Winrry [9k?\]: afk for awhile 
Tictactoe [-\]: he is chinese i presume
sh [7k\]: I wanna know is he cool enough like shi yue 
sh [7k\]: And others
Tictactoe [-\]: so many chinese topplayers and analysers
Tictactoe [-\]: those guys have at least 12 years of study advantage over poor me ^^
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol had his eyes fixed on these stones on the left, if he could cut them off somehow, he would get sente
sh [7k\]: What is your rank now anyway
Tictactoe [-\]: i beaten weak pro on even in 87, in 1991 i stopped due to medical problems
Tictactoe [-\]: as redmond said you need a sane corpus for a good mind aswell
Tictactoe [-\]: as blood is deverted from the colon to the brain, i am severe risk so i had to berry my ambitions becomming a topplayer
sh [7k\]: Lol
sh [7k\]: But
sh [7k\]: You can always try
sh [7k\]: Keep trying*
Tictactoe [-\]: not after losing parts of your colon 
Tictactoe [-\]: i recall one game i had to play without underwear due to colonproblems, i had to sneak to the bathroom to clean up
amadis [4k\]: glad you are still with us, that sounds serious
Tictactoe [-\]: it is a medical miracle that you still live my surgeon said
amadis [4k\]: so you can analyze and teach but it's too exciting to play?
Tictactoe [-\]: precisely
Tictactoe [-\]: and as we know, in igo it always goes wrong somewhere for enjoyment
amadis [4k\]: well....playing go professionally is a very hard life for anyone
Tictactoe [-\]: igo is like slapstick
Tictactoe [-\]: laurel and hardy or buster keaton could have been good goplayers
amadis [4k\]: that would be a good go book...."three stooges style"
Tictactoe [-\]: imagine charley chaplin playing black
Tictactoe [-\]: that's what igo is in my opinion trail and error all the way
Tictactoe [-\]: a life time of enjoyment, if you can let your winning ambition go
amadis [4k\]: i only want to be shodan, dear lord, but i doubt i ever will
Tictactoe [-\]: and yet i can achieve 4~5d at kgs fooling around, so i helped in the beginning years to get more players decently ranked
Tictactoe [-\]: lost to twoeye 7-2
amadis [4k\]: then i thought my son would be shodan but i don't know if he will make it either
amadis [4k\]: oh so you do actually play sometimes? i didn't know that
Tictactoe [-\]: in the end of the eighties i helped the belgium players becomming dan by analysing go sei gen jubango for an audience
Tictactoe [-\]: and in hamburg '88 go-congress i achieved 9 out of 10 defeating hans pietsch 4p aswell
Tictactoe [-\]: but with the fall of the wall, many ambitious east european flooded into the go-scene
Tictactoe [-\]: like cornel said; "i can make a decent income being go-player, in fact i earn more than being mathteacher
Tictactoe [-\]: in the west you'd never make that
sh [7k\]: I guess players like you are getting outta KGS because of the lack of serious strong players
sh [7k\]: Sometimes KGS feels like hell when people escapes
Tictactoe [-\]: have you read what mero csaba said about himself in a recent european pro-match?
sh [7k\]: No
sh [7k\]: What did he
sh [7k\]: Say
Tictactoe [-\]: something like i am the punchball of these guys that keep on overtaking me, and they get younger each year too
amadis [4k\]: now they are starting to have western pros but my question is who is going to pay these pros
amadis [4k\]: if you can't make a living at it you aren't really a pro
sh [7k\]: That should not be all.
sh [7k\]: Dude
sh [7k\]: May be you love that game  
Tictactoe [-\]: yes i discussed this subject many a time to attract sponsorship for our sport, a sport in which doping can't be used
sh [7k\]: Amadis I really love go
amadis [4k\]: yeah lee changho and lee sedol are still pretty young but they have been overtaken by younger players
sh [7k\]: But
Tictactoe [-\]: fuji-tsu is located in my town too
Tictactoe [-\]: and so is tesla
sh [7k\]: I cant be a pro 
sh [7k\]: Park jungwhan is awesome
sh [7k\]: The way he played against cho chikun
sh [7k\]: Amazing
Tictactoe [-\]: yes chikun is getting old too
sh [7k\]: I relayed it 7 times
amadis [4k\]: my plan is to develop new drugs that can make human go players as strong as a computer
Tictactoe [-\]: smart plan, quite a market
amadis [4k\]: i think if i can achieve this, the drugs may have other uses as well
sh [7k\]: Why takwmiya is not ruling like once upon a time he did
Tictactoe [-\]: i heard parsely brings good results
amadis [4k\]: yeah redmond was talking about takemiya
Tictactoe [-\]: takemiya brought the cosmic style

;B[jj]TR[mc][mg][qg][mm][qm]C[Tictactoe [-\]: games like these with kato were played
sh [7k\]: But it is very devastating watching favourite pros are not in their desired form
Tictactoe [-\]: and next whenever you invade the black territory keeps shifting around the board
sh [7k\]: Nice will you show
Tictactoe [-\]: redmond clearly explained the historical background of shusaku, go sei gen who were great assets for theory development
sh [7k\]: Some cool game of go seigen takemiya
amadis [4k\]: sh i can tell you are a young person, when you get older you will realize that you cannot always be in your desired form, or ever, but hopefully life is worth living anyway
Tictactoe [-\]: if you percieve it like mero csaba does, you'll still can enjoy
sh [7k\]: Do you happen to know any game against seigen vs takemiya?
Tictactoe [-\]: go sei gen is around wwII takemiya is thirty years later
sh [7k\]: Amadis you are probably  right 
sh [7k\]: I mean no back door game?
sh [7k\]: Unofficial?
amadis [4k\]: yeah speaking of desired form, go seigen had an accident at some point and could not play as well afterwards, but he was still an inspiration
Tictactoe [-\]: try gobase.org plenty of games stored there
sh [7k\]: Yes
sh [7k\]: Thx I will 
sh [7k\]: Nice to meet you tictatoe amadis
Tictactoe [-\]: after go sei gen, many new names popped fujisawa shuko, ishida yoshio, kato masao, cho chikun, takemiya, and they kept on comming
Tictactoe [-\]: i never made it to replay all their games, but i have replayed many of the games of these mentioned players
amadis [4k\]: nice to meet you too
Tictactoe [-\]: forgot to mention kobayashi Koichi
sh [7k\]: Yeah

;AB[cn][dp]TR[nc][pd][cn][dp]C[Tictactoe [-\]: with or without approach move, both are instensively studied by pro
Tictactoe [-\]: so knowing that pro studied these patterns most of their time, me being an amature rather avoids them ^^
Tictactoe [-\]: i know they are the best moves, but it's more fun to win with my insanely dazzling bad variation
m1m [1k\]: Dinerstein said that Lee's fuseki was bad
Tictactoe [-\]: maybe he is correct, dinerchtein is studying hard
m1m [1k\]: considering that in the middle game Lee was considered to be behind, that seems to be true
Tictactoe [-\]: but he feels the heat of these ever younger boys upon him too
Tictactoe [-\]: like artem
Tictactoe [-\]: i remeber seeing dinerchtein losing to kulkov
Tictactoe [-\]: i had to bring him to order saving the furniture of the tournament hall
m1m [1k\]: thats funny
m1m [1k\]: to hear now, but was not at that moment, probably
Tictactoe [-\]: yes he had lost a fair amount of pricemoney in that game, so i understood
Tictactoe [-\]: he just kicked his leg to one of the chairs in anger when i layed my hand on his shoulder and nodded to him, sad loss but such things happen in life
Tictactoe [-\]: next i invited him to come with me leaving this hideous room and have some more enjoyment of new life at the other side of the door, upon he nodded good idea
Tictactoe [-\]: all played in pantomime act since i don't speak russian
amadis [4k\]: i gotta got folks, nice to chat, thanks for showing us the variations tictactoe
amadis [4k\]: *go
Tictactoe [-\]: c u ^^
