funhouse [2k\]: anyone have a link to game 2 Myngwan commentary channel?
bruh [4d\]: it should be up in an hour
bruh [4d\]: the AGA did a short stream an hour ago where they said Myungwahn's commentary will start an hour after the game starts
Tictactoe [-\]: Thank you all for joining, hope i can relay well this early morning.
rsun [-\]: alphago will play some variant of chinese opening
Tictactoe [-\]: shinfuseki revival?
bruh [4d\]: alphaGo will play tengen first
lmox: Andrew Jackson is a lovely commentator
lmox: enjoy him very much
bruh [4d\]: yeah, I thought Andrew and Kim Myungwahn were FAR better commentators than Michael and Chris
Tictactoe [-\]: i fully agree Andrew does a fabulous job, can you provide the link to him?
LongLost [7k\]: I have arrived, Robot Queen, to show fealty to your precious data feet.
LongLost [7k\]: Google has the cheesiest background music.
Codexus [7k?\]: Good morning!
Naphthalin [10k?\]: alphago composed that piece @Longlost
Anatoly [2d?\]: hi all
rsun [-\]: here it comes!!
Shana [?\]: michael wasnt that bad at commentating, he probably had a gun to his head to try and keep it simple
cxcv: :o)
rsun [-\]: aja looks so cool
LongLost [7k\]: Tengen!
Naphthalin [10k?\]: just imagine, what it must mean even for a strong amateur to sit there and play a serious match against lee sedol!
rsun [-\]: alpha will play (mini/micro) chinese opening
fluidistic [-\]: good to see yoou rsun
Codexus [7k?\]: Hoshi!
rsun [-\]: hi flu
rsun [-\]: next move will be 3-4 point

LongLost [7k\]: We are the coolest viewing party..
bruh [4d\]: san-ren-sei incoming
rsun [-\]: really
fluidistic [-\]: there are 2 moves already
fluidistic [-\]: 2 hoshis
LongLost [7k\]: What could it possible be thinking about.
fluidistic [-\]: p4 was the 1st move
rsun [-\]: I only see 2 moves on the board
fluidistic [-\]: on kgs I see 0 move played
rsun [-\]: see, 3-4 point

fluidistic [-\]: 1st game se dol had black?
bruh [4d\]: yes
fluidistic [-\]: thx
zampa [-\]: will kim do commentary today aswell?
Codexus [7k?\]: I think Lee Sedol will win this one
crate [?\]: Lee get komi this time
Yumi [7d\]: i think lee is taking it a lot more seriously this time
Tictactoe [-\]: yes, having white is considered an advanatge these days due to the komi
rsun [-\]: alpha may kakari first
fluidistic [-\]: se dol trying mirror go
]
;W[qp]C[cdocdo [2k\]: haha
bruh [4d\]: hmm...well, I heard that in Chinese rules 7.5 komi, pros prefer White; but in regular 6.5 japanese rules, they are 50-50 about it
Naphthalin [10k?\]: white manego!!
LongLost [7k\]: Redmond needs an adjust on that last stone..
feeldabern [4d\]: ^^ so bothering
fluidistic [-\]: after se dol loses 5 games in a row "dude did u know u could have won with mirror go? :)  "
Naphthalin [10k?\]: @bruh: that only makes a difference, if there is a seki with 1 eye vs 1 eye
rsun [-\]: oh no, they're doing the basics all over again
fanfan [3d\]: both are ahead
rsun [-\]: I know alpha so well
funhouse [2k\]: omg, please give us Kim commentary
crate [?\]: yes the stones were crooked as vertical Goban last night
Shana [?\]: no chinese tho
Codexus [7k?\]: P4 kakari
fluidistic [-\]: p4 was played
Tictactoe [-\]: Kim will start commenting in about an hour 
bruh [4d\]: that's not true Naph, dame points can affect ko fighting as well
rsun [-\]: chinese will come later
cxcv: mirror go
rsun [-\]: unless lee plays mirror

;B[op]C[fluidistic [-\]: gimme control pliz i'll put stones faster
LongLost [7k\]: Why.. why did he not fix r4.
Matrok [3k\]: mirror go... that would be fun !
fluidistic [-\]: p3 played
Falcon89 [5k\]: haha fluid, go away
crate [?\]: darn fix that stone you were just next to it
Naphthalin [10k?\]: bruh, but do these ko fights favor one player over the other?
bryamatt [12k\]: is the youtube DeepMind stream the only one right now? won't load for me :(
rsun [-\]: alpha may tenuki after hane

Krithalith: That unlisted stream is so nice
rsun [-\]: n4 is not alpha style
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Can somebody please tell Michael Redmond to fix his microphone
Prime [2k\]: holy crap 202 observers
hgjhgjgjgh: unlisted stream
hgjhgjgjgh: ?
twoody [3k\]: Redmond is taking like black has already won o.0
USSRMan [3d\]: yesterday was 800 viewers
cdocdo [2k\]: oh n4
feeldabern [4d\]: alpha showed in first game that she like super big framework
cxcv: alpha doesn't have a style indeed
GoIngo [?\]: on youtube livestream 97,000
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I bet AlphaGo could wear a microphone better than Michael Redmond with a few more years development
fluidistic [-\]: n4 wow
robsclone: yes @feeldabern
bruh [4d\]: this is textbook and old-fashioned opening
kdbaby14 [6k\]: N-4 is popular indeed
tsukiatari [1d\]: I knew this was going to appear
Krithalith: Unlisted stream was posted at move 5 by kado (second link). It has no commentary just the game

;B[mp]C[rsun [-\]: I'd like to see alpha doing sth special
feeldabern [4d\]: like tenuki here?
Sez [12k\]: is there any commentary stream?
rsun [-\]: I mean for the opening
Meloe [-\]: tenuki is not special for Lee
LordTushi [9k?\]: I'm amazed that alpha go only needs 2h to play a game
njs [1d\]: Lee needs to play carefully
Sachan [?\]: maybe they'll tell it to tengen if it wins this game for the next one 
aham [8k\]: E16
bruh [4d\]: O5 next
njs [1d\]: Otherwise he'll get absolutely, completely, entirely rekt.
USSRMan [3d\]: r6
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Sez watch here for Michael Redmond live commentary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-GsfyVCBu0
Long [?\]: alphago is SAI ; super artificial intelligence
Marathon [-\]: there's a commentary stream on youtube 
USSRMan [3d\]: i think lee will choose a very standard opening this game
njs [1d\]: q5?
saiiii1k: oh noes
aham [8k\]: C9
cxcv: bingo
]
;W[qn]C[bruh [4d\]: just r5 :(
bruh [4d\]: r6*
Rephos [23k\]: here it goes lagging again
njs [1d\]: lee is being careful
asdfg: is it AGA stream?
twoody [3k\]: Who is this new guy?
Tsuijin [1d?\]: God's father
aham [8k\]: trop lent r6
hgjhgjgjgh: is there an aga stream?
adfafdsfaf: programmer with google
USSRMan [3d\]: I wonder how alphago does in peaceful games
Prime [2k\]: aga stream isnt live yet
bryamatt [12k\]: aga stream in 45 min i think
hgjhgjgjgh: got it
Matrok [3k\]: next J3, black will stick to its database
kdbaby14 [6k\]: B can D-10?
cxcv: need some muse from Sai
rsun [-\]: yes!
twoody [3k\]: Thanks you left-hand-smashing-keyboard ;)
feeldabern [4d\]: HA
bruh [4d\]: oh, very interesting
rsun [-\]: alpha hears me
feeldabern [4d\]: alpha did do tenuki
isbhal [-\]: ahahhahahah
kadoban [?\]: I think if B is going to do D10, they don't do N4 first?
feeldabern [4d\]: normally, but n4 for r6 isn't such a bad exchange
rsun [-\]: google somehow hooked up alpha to me
JohnNothaf [23k\]: White is Lee right 
cxcv: J17 is weird-_-
bababobo [1d?\]: any one have any idea of total live audience for this even on all media ?
escudero [3k\]: j17
bruh [4d\]: K4 is almost a must now
covert: Black j17
Prime [2k\]: b plays j17
robsclone: 30k+  on the american youtube stream
Prime [2k\]: lol i love how all of us are like "J17!!!!!"
Falcon89 [5k\]: yes John
JohnNothaf [23k\]: Thank you 
covert: so it's a chinese deferred
bababobo [1d?\]: thanks
bruh [4d\]: sad that Chen Zude isn't alive to witness AlphaGo playing his opening
isbhal [-\]: h17 better 
oldguy [4d\]: who's taking b/w?
Tictactoe [-\]: it's j17 isn't it
Dom [6d\]: such a boring opening again
highhand [5k\]: I do not understand how come so much time spent on the obvious b J3 joseki move
kadoban [?\]: Black is alphago
feeldabern [4d\]: b is not playing j3
Tictactoe [-\]: hard to see the hoshi on the camera
feeldabern [4d\]: and j3 is not obvious
GoIngo [?\]: good choice by alpha-team
hgjhgjgjgh: dom again? yesterday was insane
gogonuts [4d\]: I'm glad it's boring
oldguy [4d\]: I am using mobile app client, cannot see the chat history :-(
USSRMan [3d\]: In fan vs alpha game 1, these peaceful territorial games favors alphago
]
;B[ic]C[Dom [6d\]: yea, sorry
Dom [6d\]: yesterday wasnt boring
Matrok [3k\]: oh? he plays something else than the GoGoD database. He never did in Fan Hui's game
Dom [6d\]: but ugly
Sachan [?\]: so for game 1 yesterday Michael Redmond seemed very surprised that lee sedol resigned when he did, saying that he thought there was still a chance for him to win. but with the AGA stream they predicted lee resigning like 30 mins before he did - sooooooo why was Micheal Redmond so wrong? Lots of his insights seemed to contradict what the guys on AGA were saying. 
njs [1d\]: boring....?!
cxcv: what is obvious? what is right? What is wrong? All relative concepts to rank
gogonuts [4d\]: lee has to take it really seriously to win
Sez [12k\]: XiJinping2: thx
zxcvbnm [1d\]: Hm? I thought it wasn't allowed to be broadcasted here?
USSRMan [3d\]: alpha 5-0 sweep lee sedol
kdbaby14 [6k\]: Michael Redmond probably never play chinese rule before
GoIngo [?\]: fj said Lee can live with pressure
USSRMan [3d\]: Im sure he has played chinese rules lol
louou: well, redmond ha to multitask, answering questions like with go's history basic rules etc.
kdbaby14 [6k\]: he did said that he not familiar with Chinese scoring
njs [1d\]: Why is alphago not completing joseki haha
USSRMan [3d\]: it is almost always the same as japanese rules scoring, just easier to program
adancassan [13k?\]: Interesting talk with one of the developers at the DeepMind stream right now
kdbaby14 [6k\]: I dont think J-3 is efficient though
lxom: I would play l4
louou: it looks from these two games that AG is using time really well.
lxom: but that seems too slow
bruh [4d\]: i think K4 makes the tiger mouth look awkward
yoyoma [2d?\]: Sachan I don't think Redmond was surprised at the resign, he was just trying to follow some official procedure where some other official was supposed to declare the resignation
fanfan [3d\]: AlphaGo didn't completed the joseki to give us a chance to comment
canzsta: e16
feeldabern [4d\]: even if white plays a move where black would have played it, black can tenuki once again perhaps
Sachan [?\]: ah kk
yoyoma [2d?\]: But that process didn't go smoothly so he was left hanging
USSRMan [3d\]: k4
fluidistic [-\]: looks like a 2 or 3 handicap stones game to me
USSRMan [3d\]: if i were lee
fluidistic [-\]: b well ahead
cxcv: move on the left
crate [?\]: Alpha may play k10 first
Azal [2d\]: well... AG left 2 groups weak 
rsun [-\]: K4 is sedol style
jellyroll: w resign soon
USSRMan [3d\]: k10 is bad 
murky [?\]: pro thinks that B is behind by one stone now
bababobo [1d?\]: so w can make lots of territory at bottom while bot takes top
gogonuts [4d\]: thore is really great for public relations :-)
fluidistic [-\]: murky this means that b leads
crate [?\]: k10 will be played sooner or later
USSRMan [3d\]: pros dont understand this opening, it is like a chess bot inventing new openings
aham [8k\]: d10
murky [?\]: W leads
Azal [2d\]: murky... which pros?
gogonuts [4d\]: it's murky
murky [?\]: top Chinese pro's comment
murky [?\]: Chen Yaoye
murky [?\]: 9p\\
isbhal [-\]: ok bro cool bro
Azal [2d\]: is he streaming ?
Jsnake [?\]: Is Lee freaking out? 
gogonuts [4d\]: important move for w now
USSRMan [3d\]: redmond said n4 is heavy style of play
rsun [-\]: lee has to pincer
indogo [11k?\]: comentary is good on youtube :)
njs [1d\]: lee is like alphago stop sucking
USSRMan [3d\]: but alpha probably played this opening 1trillion times
fanfan [3d\]: against alphaGo, all moves are important
]
;W[dj]C[okiol [1k\]: that's basic idea, right, USSR?
shashwat [7k?\]: alpha's looking for a fight, it seems
feeldabern [4d\]: see, lee doesn't spend a move to attack either
manta [3d\]: lee will probably go to byoyomi today
Azal [2d\]: murky... pls keep commenting Yaoye's comments
hgjhgjgjgh: buckle up :)
okiol [1k\]: i mean, i would assume all dan players would "know" that consideration
rsun [-\]: looks like end of fuseki again
cxcv: yup..on the left
highhand [5k\]: if Lee play a bot move like h14 (instead of d10) would he lose quikly?
USSRMan [3d\]: n4 for r6 doesn't look that bad to me, AI probably thinks it is ok
aham [8k\]: hÃ© hÃ© 
gogonuts [4d\]: d10 very circumspect
aham [8k\]: j'ai dit d10
heather [1k\]: too far from c16 gogo?
LordTushi [9k?\]: d10 is interesting
aham [8k\]: c'est pour Ã§a qu'il perd
Rankachan [6k\]: d10 is good ?
gogonuts [4d\]: lee is determined not to end up in the alphago grinder :-)
bruh [4d\]: i guess, if W plays K4, B tenuki and play D10 looks too good
atiyah [3d?\]: i'm guessing b will extend on the right
lxom: d10 feels right to me
njs [1d\]: tu es vraiment intelligent aham ;)
Tictactoe [-\]: Alphago plays under the uk-colours
fluidistic [-\]: q5 played
]
;B[po]C[fluidistic [-\]: what's that move?
gooooo [?\]: wow weird
Shana [?\]: lee sedol looked uncomfortable in that cam
danielhast [?\]: ...is this joseki?
escudero [3k\]: d10 maybe to prepare attack at l4?
covert: that looks... strange
glasszee [3k\]: ...
Anatoly [2d?\]: wow
LordTushi [9k?\]: q5?!
fluidistic [-\]: ko threat lost?
Anatoly [2d?\]: what?
Rankachan [6k\]: q5 is joseki ?
njs [1d\]: ?!
Prime [2k\]: LMAO 
USSRMan [3d\]: yup, inventing new fusekis
Sachan [?\]: wow
feeldabern [4d\]: q5 is a normal exchange but very early
Ephidel [1k\]: what?
Sachan [?\]: this is interesting~
njs [1d\]: Im expecting a new joseki revolution
feeldabern [4d\]: alphago really loves to make these exchanges
cxcv: L4/ K4,etc looks a bit concentrated
Sachan [?\]: alphago is so aggressive haha
glasszee [3k\]: b begins endgame
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: This is the start of the New Fuseki Era, people
Prime [2k\]: we should just let this bot come up with new fuseki for the future
Ephidel [1k\]: very computer move
Jumadan [?\]: tenuki now?
feeldabern [4d\]: w can't tenuki this
Tictactoe [-\]: q5 is a common follow-up, it's kind of kikashi in this pattern
Garp [11k\]: is there yet a god analsis of yesterday match? could leer won ?
feeldabern [4d\]: s7 or r7 for w are common
okiol [1k\]: ok, so let's see... in the fan hui games there were some criticism that alphago were making exchanges like these too early - let's see if lee can actually abuse that
LordTushi [9k?\]: Yeah, q5 is common. It's just very early
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Thanks, Tactictoe
USSRMan [3d\]: i agree, very computer-like move, humans dont like making these exchanges because it is not flexible
GoIngo [?\]: will we see moyo game by alha today?
Jumadan [?\]: why not feeldabern?
GoIngo [?\]: alpha
LongLost [7k\]: DeepMind explainer is ruining my romanticism of AlphaGo! Silence.
glasszee [3k\]: after D10, unlikely
escudero [3k\]: isn't this just forcing exchange? it removes some aji though
bert [?\]: q6 not good for w now?
feeldabern [4d\]: black push and cut is very severe
highhand [5k\]: b q5 interesting, attacking a strong group
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Isn't C6 in danger? Or does N4 make C6 okay?
feeldabern [4d\]: so w will answer in some way
buhaypa [3k\]: Is 7.5 komi usual? Seems like a huge burden
gooooo [?\]: I wanted to see Lees reaction to this move
zavion [2k\]: romanticism of alphago? u in love with skynet?
covert: lee connects
USSRMan [3d\]: c6 is 
kadoban [?\]: 7.5 is standard komi for chinese rules
USSRMan [3d\]: c6 is light
Tictactoe [-\]: extending to j3 is walking head on towards a solid f3 stone, and might invite m3 
Jumadan [?\]: is it big enough that early?
aab [?\]: Korean BadukTV stream and some brief English translations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bATCEcRbBzE  https://twitter.com/askakorean
wolvie [?\]: Yeah, they cut away from his reaction in the stream :/
buhaypa [3k\]: Ah ok thanks
okiol [1k\]: USSR, the theory behind these "mistimed" and sometimes just bad exchanges based on how the board looked, was that alphago just didn't have understanding over the position enough, and just played common moves
]
;W[qo]C[kadoban [?\]: 6.5 komiisn't meaningful in chinese counting, so it's either 5.5 or 7.5
Jumadan [?\]: appearently itis
Jumadan [?\]: :D
Naphthalin [10k?\]: 6.5 is nearly the same as 5.5
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: USSRMan - C6 light  and now R4 solid
USSRMan [3d\]: sure
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I guess black will settle C6 and N4 right now with his turn
njs [1d\]: can't white play r7 instead of r5
]
;B[cp]
;W[cq]C[gogonuts [4d\]: thore too polite to correct michael :-)
rsun [-\]: alpha is sure doing some very special stuff this game
manta [3d\]: r7 leaves aji
USSRMan [3d\]: r7 is bad aji
lcc [4k\]: Lee spends more time than yesterday's
fluidistic [-\]: now what
feeldabern [4d\]: r7 doesn't keep as much pressure on o3
gogonuts [4d\]: and lee sedol isn't - he's really on his guard
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: You guys are really giving helpful kibitz, thank you
feeldabern [4d\]: but r7 is also possible
Long [?\]: alphago will still win though

Sigrosa [7k\]: is there more commentary aside from michael redmond?
goren22 [2k\]: j3 or k4 or something.  Itching to play that
rsun [-\]: but only by human standards
Tictactoe [-\]: apparently alphago likes to settle it's shape fastly
Sachan [?\]: aga will be on in like an hour
lxom: as W I would now d3 and then k3
Ilyo: There is commentary from Korean and Chinese pros.
USSRMan [3d\]: j3 probably overconcentrated
njs [1d\]: q14
USSRMan [3d\]: for white
Ilyo: Korean commentary can be found on baduktv.
Sigrosa [7k\]: okay, I heard kim did some yesterday
bruh [4d\]: so far I really like W's position

rsun [-\]: you missed game 1?
bruh [4d\]: is Gu Li in an aquarium? :)
aham [8k\]: c2
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: rsun - Yes
okiol [1k\]: alphago seems really strong in fighting
USSRMan [3d\]: bots are actually really strong at complex fighting games
njs [1d\]: aham, ce n'est pas tres dificile de choisir les moves qui sont vraiment aleatoires
Mars [10k?\]: D3
USSRMan [3d\]: they have mastered the game 9x9
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: rsun - I want to read the write-up for the match but this game is going too quickly even though it's fuseki still :)
aham [8k\]: si c'est difficile
gogonuts [4d\]: lee still has only a very vague idea of what alphago can do, so just playing his own game is a good idea
]
;B[dq]
;W[ep]C[aham [8k\]: mais facile de trouver les coups traditionnels
jockey: no variations?
Prime [2k\]: holy crap 168,000 people watching the chinese stream
Matrok [3k\]: rha... those journalists ! Can't they switch their mobile phones off ?!
Uberdude [2d\]: this looks troublesome for white if black plays c7 etc as d10 is high not low
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: USSRMan - But time limit might give practiced human player an edge over a tree-reading computer. No idea to what extent, though, if that's even true
njs [1d\]: mais tu as mis trois moves
Jumadan [?\]: apart from that fight i think Xi is right a moyo style play would work better i guess
njs [1d\]: dans le chat
pony16 [4k\]: i don't think the human should play differently because he is playing a computer
Mars [10k?\]: d2
USSRMan [3d\]: lee favors playing complicated games vs other pros because he reads better than them, but alphago is a different animal
]
;B[dr]C[bruh [4d\]: now, with K4, W's position looks so good
]
;W[cm]C[Uberdude [2d\]: k4 would be disaster
feeldabern [4d\]: but it's black's turn
Uberdude [2d\]: black would c7
Sigrosa [7k\]: how do they choose who plays black or white?
bruh [4d\]: oh wait, sorry, forgot that W needs C7
Azal [2d\]: mmmm
DemonStyle [3d?\]: They did nigiri in game 1
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: pony16 - True, but it is a game and the point is to beat your opponent. And at this point it would only be a delaying action... the computer would come back stronger sooner rather than later in a few month or a year
DemonStyle [3d?\]: I think they alternate after that
njs [1d\]: tough to say who is wiwnning
Marathon [-\]: they had nigiri yesterday, after that, they alternate colors
rsun [-\]: b j3 is honte
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: USSRMan - Ah
Tictactoe [-\]: first game was a nigiri, so this game is in reverse colours
julbla [4k\]: link of the chinese stream?
LongLost [7k\]: Redmon correct when he totally ignores other commentator.
fluidistic [-\]: r10
aham [8k\]: q14
Ilyo: http://www.douyutv.com/533882 chinese stream
gogonuts [4d\]: k4 even more honte :-)
bruh [4d\]: is J3 appropriate in this position? feel like K3 is more appropriate
adfafdsfaf: Longlost you are right
Kolie34A: It's just the beginning of the game,still close
gogonuts [4d\]: played k4
rsun [-\]: now they hooked alpha to gogo's brain
gogonuts [4d\]: :-)
USSRMan [3d\]: k4 over j3?
]
;B[jp]C[feeldabern [4d\]: k4 good choice
Azal [2d\]: wow Gu Li commenting
Sigrosa [7k\]: did alphago choose "odd" or "even" for nigiri? ;)
USSRMan [3d\]: stylish
covert: odd - yesterday
covert: this is reversed colors from yesterday's game
bruh [4d\]: c14 now?
Sigrosa [7k\]: that's funny it chose haha
DemonStyle [3d?\]: I think Aja Huang chose on AlphaGo's behalf. :)
Ilyo: c14 seems early
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Sigrosa - It chose an 7.5 komi + sqrt(-1)
Uberdude [2d\]: i like how the chinese stream tells you the weight of the female host
Ilyo: I feel drawn to lower center
fluidistic [-\]: lol
LongLost [7k\]: I only watch >64kg hosts.
Uberdude [2d\]: getting the important details in
bruh [4d\]: the things that matter
TaoTao: jammed ?
gogonuts [4d\]: i must say, since d10 alpha has been smart at fixing things
LordTushi [9k?\]: The white text on the chinese stream is annoying ^^'
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I only weigh 7kg? according to KGS
Relativity [8k\]: you can disable it lord
Uberdude [2d\]: you can remove the texct
danielhast [?\]: time for R14, or not yet?
Uberdude [2d\]: click thingy below video
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Actually I am more like 2-3k but super out of practice
Mars [10k?\]: so many people are hosting this game.
LordTushi [9k?\]: Oh! Thanks a lot
Uberdude [2d\]: orange with 4 stripes
cxcv: K4 seems a nice move of balance
LordTushi [9k?\]: That's 10x more watchable
rsun [-\]: e16 honte
danielhast [?\]: ah, guess W has more potential on left
bruh [4d\]: c13 instead
zampa [-\]: do anyone know if kim will review teh game today?
]
;W[cg]C[rsun [-\]: c13 then e16 honte
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: E16 for white, rsun?
TheHeliox [?\]: c7
goren22 [2k\]: j5 
rsun [-\]: no, I mean e16 is honte now
Azal [2d\]: c13 feels slooow
buhaypa [3k\]: Kim is supposed to, yes
JohnNothaf [23k\]: Yes in about 20 minutes 
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: This game is moving so quickly, 4 hours total is going so fast
zampa [-\]: Awesome! :D
liptos [3k\]: hmm why c13 over say r14?
Uberdude [2d\]: white o17 next?
Ephidel [1k\]: if white doesn't c13...
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Maybe they are saving their thinking time for later
Ephidel [1k\]: then b plays c13?
Uberdude [2d\]: r14 is boring
USSRMan [3d\]: d14
buhaypa [3k\]: Kim's commentary yesterday was great
Uberdude [2d\]: r6 makes that area small
manta [3d\]: right side not interesting
kadoban [?\]: R6 is low and the right is a bit uninteresting.
rsun [-\]: r14 is wrong direction by human standards
Tictactoe [-\]: white rather be at o17 seeing the strength of r6
goren22 [2k\]: e16 is like a must now no?
Mars [10k?\]: e16
bruh [4d\]: e16 is standard
]
;B[ed]C[bryamatt [12k\]: yeah e16 already played
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: You know, I wish the Google Guy would come out and talk about how the computer manages its thinking time on each move... when does it use lots of thinking time, and when does it think for a short amount of time, etc.
LongLost [7k\]: I like Black. White not strong or courageous enough to fight back.
highhand [5k\]: w K14 instead of c13 playable ?
danielhast [?\]: now R14?
buhaypa [3k\]: W is plenty of both
Tictactoe [-\]: rsun predicts alphago 100% accurate, fear rsun ^^
lxom: rsun terrifying 
rsun [-\]: lol
manta [3d\]: i prefer w here
bruh [4d\]: r14 last big point
cxcv: rsun can be the next candidate
rsun [-\]: gogo got k4 right
USSRMan [3d\]: it is actually alphago predicting rsun moves
hgjhgjgjgh: i prefer b, we should do a strawpoll :P
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I prefer w also
Azal [2d\]: what is Gu Li saying xD?
Kolie34A: r14 one of the choices
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: w has entire board to choose from now
LordTushi [9k?\]: is lee sedol really playing againt alphago? Maybe it's just rsun playing on that computer...
rsun [-\]: w may have to play o17
Ephidel [1k\]: why not 3-3 at r17?
hondra [1d?\]: I'd be more interested to know if they plan to publish the program, sell it as a product, ... or in general future plans.
robsclone: it's cautious, but I actually have liked white's opening
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: E4 is kind of in an unsettled place though
goren22 [2k\]: k16?
blau3: as long as W got C13 "in sente", he didn't mind postponing R14 for a moment
jellyroll: r14?
TaoTao: 17o
rsun [-\]: r14 is bad direction
Ephidel [1k\]: r17??
rsun [-\]: lee suddenly realizes he doesn't have a good move now
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: LordTushi - What if they are the same thing..........
cxcv: R6 group is low
LongLost [7k\]: AlphaGo "skims" with Monte Carlo simulation 10,000x fold.
Ephidel [1k\]: just get more corner points
Kolie34A: It seems quite hard to find a great move now
kaliya [-\]: I would like to be W here
TaoTao: 17o is better
Lilou [1d\]: pub for LoL, just seen a LOL and a faker on chinses stream
TaoTao: o17
manta [3d\]: o17 here?
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol blinks his eyes alot, he is studying the now
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Lee Sedol thinking a lot this move
Lilou [1d\]: K16?
Sachan [?\]: so outside of against itself... when was the last time alphago lost? Is she gonna be sad when/if she loses against Lee Sedol?! Let's make sure to support AlphaGo no matter the outcome!
Ephidel [1k\]: lol
okiol [1k\]: what's he waiting for, just play r14 already
Ephidel [1k\]: not much to gain on the right side
LordTushi [9k?\]: #realcomputershavefeelings?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Hey guys, what is going on with Lee Changho lately? Is he still playing pro or is Lee Sedol top player now?
robsclone: I wonder if AlphaGo has any concept of the oppenent's "intention" or if each move is made independently
LongLost [7k\]: Wow -- is that real-time translation coming from my Google Translate mechanism -- or douyutv?
rsun [-\]: o16 happy for b
Prime [2k\]: #realcomputershavefeelings
twoody [3k\]: R14 is enough?
Firien [?\]: ke jie is maybe the best, but lee is a legend
]
;W[qf]C[bruh [4d\]: well, AlphaGo did lose 2 games out of 5 against Fan Hui, in fast game settings
cxcv: Lee looks grimmer than yesterday
cxcv: :o
fluidistic [-\]: bruh that's not the same alphago
Long [?\]: ohhhh
hondra [1d?\]: Sedol played the bad direction move, eh?
TaoTao: oh 
Mars [10k?\]: maybe o17?
Ephidel [1k\]: maybe the plan is 3-3 directly after b O16
bruh [4d\]: yes, the October version
danielhast [?\]: wow, my intuition wasn't completely off
fluidistic [-\]: october version is light years behind this one
trippin [2k\]: bruh, alphago was weaker in october
USSRMan [3d\]: alphago has a trillion games more than when it played against fan hui
USSRMan [3d\]: experience is everything
Kolie34A: o16?
goren22 [2k\]: r15 like for sure?
bruh [4d\]: the question was whether alphaGo lost, just answering :).
LordTushi [9k?\]: How many games did alphago had when playing Fan Hui?
trippin [2k\]: ah
Eternal6k [6k?\]: Q14
Marathon [-\]: a trillion? 
bruh [4d\]: otherwise we may as well just say it's only played 1 game
GoIngo [?\]: crazystone gives balanced evaluatin, but does not like r14 much
Kolie34A: alphago can learn 
rsun [-\]: cool
]
;B[qe]C[Codexus [7k?\]: I can't decide if I'd rather play b or w in this position
danielhast [?\]: um
blau3: r15 to make W overconcentrated?
Ephidel [1k\]: whoa
Jumadan [?\]: kick?
Rankachan [6k\]: lee played the bad direction move gg
highhand [5k\]: if w o17 instead would have been under severe attack?
blau3: too late...
glasszee [3k\]: kick good
Long [?\]: wow
Sachan [?\]: aggressive~
Ahamay [7d?\]: R15 strong, Lee must have expected this
Long [?\]: simply wow
Sachan [?\]: I love alphago
Sachan [?\]: :3
kdbaby14 [6k\]: W does not look too good
Kolie34A: Hard to invade for white?
Kashomon [2k?\]: Seems balanced so far

;W[pf]C[cxcv: K4 is shining 
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Is AlphaGo tweeting the announcers? Bad ettiquette while playing
LongLost [7k\]: Let's tweet to YouTube!
gogonuts [4d\]: w had no alternative to q14
goren22 [2k\]: now 016 or o17?
Sachan [?\]: wait we can tweet? who do we tweet to?
highhand [5k\]: next w p7, prepare to attack o3 group
miai [1d\]: o16 only move
Trevoke [?\]: To the AGA twitter account
liptos [3k\]: this has been a much more peaceful game than last 
Jumadan [?\]: doesnt a move around q10 look great for w?
trippin [2k\]: someone tweet to ask about alphago time control
blacksea: @theaga
trippin [2k\]: how does it know how long to think
LongLost [7k\]: Tweet to commentator: When 9d speaking, permit him to finish speaking before you speak.
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: trippin - Yes please
]
;B[nd]C[trippin [2k\]: hah
Krithalith: Q10?
Azal [2d\]: yes q10for sure
danielhast [?\]: why would B make R15-Q14 exchange?
hondra [1d?\]: q11 it is
blau3: korigatachi
]
;W[pi]C[feeldabern [4d\]: for that sweet sweet corner money

Lilou [1d\]: fat corner
fluidistic [-\]: w trying to get some territory
ookwrd [11k\]: anyone got the link to the AGA stream?
Jumadan [?\]: why not q10?
hondra [1d?\]: w trying to invite an invasion
Rankachan [6k\]: 2 space jump ?
Mars [10k?\]: why q11?
goren22 [2k\]: nah, w now plays p7 and goes for a massive fight when b invades
adfafdsfaf: 2 space high, though.
JohnNothaf [23k\]: Just search aga youtube chanel on youtube 
danielhast [?\]: ookwrd, AGA stream not up yet
Kolie34A: hm
okiol [1k\]: i'm guessing so that s14 s13 s15 isn't sente
rsun [-\]: b's next move will sparkle
goren22 [2k\]: now b q10
danielhast [?\]: will be here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s
JohnNothaf [23k\]: It will show up once online 
kgsjdh [2k\]: game seems so boring, like no real fighting spirit, anyone else think so too, just like me?
manta [3d\]: q10 is open on two sides
okiol [1k\]: and r6 already thick, so
LordTushi [9k?\]: I feel like a bomb's about to drop on white
rsun [-\]: b's next move will be close to genius, if not kami no itte
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: danielhast - I'm watching Michael Redmond's commentary here live https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-GsfyVCBu0
cxcv: n14 fancy move yeah
ookwrd [11k\]: yea I'm doing the same
rsun [-\]: see what I said?!
Sachan [?\]: nah dong agree at all @kgsjdh - alphago has the most fighting spirit
Eternal6k [6k?\]: P7
LongLost [7k\]: So fascinating anticipating the AlphaGo fuseki.
Ephidel [1k\]: whoaaa
Ephidel [1k\]: p10??

;B[oj]C[hondra [1d?\]: one hand of hair

cxcv: ooh
LordTushi [9k?\]: p10?!
glasszee [3k\]: this is somehting
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Game getting interesting

blacksea: Also on the Youtube Gaming network: 
kaliya [-\]: p10?
bruh [4d\]: this is indeed, kami no itte
kdbaby14 [6k\]: P10
Anatoly [2d?\]: attack from the sky!

Kolie34A: center
Ephidel [1k\]: this is totally Zen style
kdbaby14 [6k\]: P10 is nice move
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Hahahahaha Michael Redmond did a second-take on P10
feeldabern [4d\]: alpha's strong move :D
goren22 [2k\]: but w will do the same at k16 soon
USSRMan [3d\]: this is a teaching game lol
GoIngo [?\]: how would shirov say: fire on board

Krithalith: Lee left lol
Long [?\]: wow
gogonuts [4d\]: bot revolution :-)
Long [?\]: simply wow
fanweiqi [8d\]: wow

Sachan [?\]: that doubletake from Michael Redmond when he placed that move
Rankachan [6k\]:  5th line shoulder hit  gg
Azal [2d\]: need to fight back now
anton007 [-\]: very strange move
blacksea: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=l-GsfyVCBu0
Ahamay [7d?\]: resign :p
cxcv: hands in the air
Dead [1k\]: Alpha likes to push on 5th line ;)
highhand [5k\]: why q11 instead of something likw w q10, now w seem to be under attack
rsun [-\]: all textbooks need to be rewritten
tiki [2k\]: O-5
gogonuts [4d\]: it makes sense when you see it
goren22 [2k\]: combined with a coming s15 b will seriously reduce w on the right
aham [8k\]: q10
helioxxx: prochain coup dans 30 minutes gg
gogonuts [4d\]: because b had no other sentes
isbhal [-\]: its how to take lead when chuban begin 
fanweiqi [8d\]: I learned something
Shana [?\]: ragequit
LordTushi [9k?\]: I feel like P10 puts black ahead
gogonuts [4d\]: human blind spot
njs [1d\]: Guys
isbhal [-\]: play 5 line before ur opponent 
fluidistic [-\]: this kind of moves are 10d and up
Slarty [1d\]: q11 leaves one gap instead of two
njs [1d\]: Why won't white play q10 instead of q11
Prime [2k\]: omg the online video they posted on youtube of the first game has 1.3 million views
Jumadan [?\]: p 6-7-8 maybe?
Sachan [?\]: hahahha
Sachan [?\]: lee left
Tictactoe [-\]: Lee went out for a walk after seeing this move
Lilou [1d\]: x9 lee for leave the game plz surrend 20
Sigrosa [7k\]: lee left the room lol
Skippy [9k\]: I love how that feels so much, I like black's five bottom stones now so much better
gogonuts [4d\]: lee sedol puking on the toilet
LongLost [7k\]: The move is a declaration of alpha-go-male supremacy.
hondra [1d?\]: Lee escaped
Marathon [-\]: is that an ear-reddening move?
Long [?\]: wow
cxcv: Gu Li is laughing
Long [?\]: simply wow
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Can we confirm reports that Lee Sedol just ran out of the playing room crying with tears in his eyes cursing "Those frackin toasters"
kdbaby14 [6k\]: this move heart every way
heather [1k\]: this is fascinating strategy by bot
covert: lilou: report black intentional feeding
cata [2k\]: obviously alphago is already winning by 3.5 so it doesn't matter that he made this move and lost 2 points
kdbaby14 [6k\]: this move hurts
aham [8k\]: Q7
fanweiqi [8d\]: Your teachers will reprimand you for playing this way
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Yes, P10 is awesome. Let's see how this turns out :D
Lilou [1d\]: ^^
fanweiqi [8d\]: that is when you say to them
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Haha Fanweiqi

Rankachan [6k\]: P10 was misclick
manta [3d\]: what else here but q10?try to fight?
Lilou [1d\]: i need a gank jungler !
helioxxx: report teemo bot pls
Azal [2d\]: Lee looking his joseki dictionary...
Sigrosa [7k\]: computers don't click ;)
InMedio [10k?\]: lol lilou
TaoTao: maybe Alpha has different idea...
ZhugeLiang [2k\]: it seems Alpha will win all 5 games
okiol [1k\]: kasparov tried to introduce a new symbol for moves like that in chess notation, fanweiqi :)
Sweetrip [9d\]: p10 looks like genius
USSRMan [3d\]: Lee resigned
fanweiqi [8d\]: so now we know this is not horrible
covert: lilou: black is clearly Heimerdinger
Lilou [1d\]: plz stop these combo jhin teemo traps !
gogonuts [4d\]: this move is a real psychological blow, imo
murky [?\]: Chen Yaoye is shocked by this B move
LordTushi [9k?\]: P10 is either genius or a huge blunder
ranyee [3k\]: isnt it strange?
Uberdude [2d\]: gu li seems a fun guy
fanweiqi [8d\]: therefore, we can figure out something
LordTushi [9k?\]: There's no inbetween
Rankachan [6k\]: misclick by alpha go i think
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Did Lee escape
InMedio [10k?\]: master yi op plz nerf
fanweiqi [8d\]: alphago is making us stronger
liptos [3k\]: hey fanweuiqi, do you approve of Q11?
Uberdude [2d\]: even though i dont speak chinese
Sweetrip [9d\]: it makes white so overconcentrated
Azal [2d\]: murky... shock in which sense?? too bad or too strong?
fanweiqi [8d\]: absolutely
isbhal [-\]: can we have link for chinese and korean commentary ?
Sweetrip [9d\]: its one of those moves
goren22 [2k\]: has to be q9 no?
Sachan [?\]: motto from alphago: always be greedy
bruh [4d\]: lol players DansGame
Sweetrip [9d\]: we may consider for a split second
murky [?\]: he thinks this make no sense
robsclone: it's pretty balanced, support-wise with teh stones on either side of the board
liptos [3k\]: ok, thanks
KobeGote [6k?\]: Sweeptrip is totally in love with AlphaBot after these two games :)
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone did not expect p10 at all
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Sweetrip - What's your initial one-second gut reaction to P10?
Jumadan [?\]: i'm telling you its p7
ZhugeLiang [2k\]: face sweating move
Sweetrip [9d\]: and dismiss it immediately not because we think its bad
goren22 [2k\]: I will bet money on w q9
Azal [2d\]: who the hell is crazystone?
escudero [3k\]: a go seigen move
helioxxx: lee's  back
robsclone: wp7 Jumadan?
Sweetrip [9d\]: but all our previous instruction tells us its bad
Jumadan [?\]: yep
Sweetrip [9d\]: i like it
cxcv: P10 is s historic move
JohnNothaf [23k\]: Why is p10 weird? Sorry, just watching on here 
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone french bot
rsun [-\]: I didn't know alpha would play here, but I called it was going to play a kami no itte
gogonuts [4d\]: yes, p10 is the dark side of the moon for humans
covert: bruh: MrDestructoid (but seriously; this looks so weird, I havne't played for years but I was 3k when I did play actively)
Sweetrip [9d\]: black normally plays p7, but that will not be sente
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Guys do you think Lee Sedol has his own Samsung-operated Go AI that he is currently consulting with???
helioxxx: plus qu'une demi heure vant le prochain coup
Sweetrip [9d\]: and at this point, black certainly wants to build center influence
playerx [1k?\]: is there a stream on aga chanell too like yesterday ? someone has the link ?, somehow I cant find it
Uberdude [2d\]: is sweetrip Andy Liu?
jellyroll: Lee is back... after two shots of whiskey.
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Ohhhhhhhhh that "I don't believe it" head shake from Lee Sedol just now
Sweetrip [9d\]: and top center is more valuable than bottom center
kdbaby14 [6k\]: probably aiming for C-6 and D-5 support?
Jumadan [?\]: p10 would me so slow for w i guess
Sachan [?\]: building that moyo~
fanweiqi [8d\]: I do not understand 
okiol [1k\]: John, p10 is weird to see, because it's inviting w to take points on the fourth line with q10 etc
AnthonyC [3k\]: p10 is on the 5th line forcing w to make territory
njs [1d\]: Andy Liu is cloudnotes maybe also sweetrip
Jumadan [?\]: i mean now
murky [?\]: Lee Sodel went to smoke
Rukas33 [11k\]: Holy cow
fanweiqi [8d\]: but i will appreciate it
Rukas33 [11k\]: He left?
fanweiqi [8d\]: transforming our understanding
WiteDragon [3k\]: He's back
hondra [1d?\]: i wish there was a chat rank filter T_T
aham [8k\]: Q7
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol now returned considering his reply
liptos [3k\]: the cool thing is Lee doesn't have to hide his emotions at all like you have to when playing a human opponent, he can just talk aloud when he plays lol
trippin [2k\]: doesn't lee sedol know computers play strangely?
njs [1d\]: Sedol smokkes?
robsclone: he's learning, trippin
hondra [1d?\]: next w move will be brutal
Lilou [1d\]: weed 
goren22 [2k\]: q9 and ascend to godhood
golgo13 [7k\]: q8
rsun [-\]: that's why I autokibitz when playing bots
Bahji [4k\]: Some people should ask questions from here to promote the KGS go server...
gogonuts [4d\]: he has no previous bot experience i think
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Liptos - Google is working on the natural language translation... give it some time before it can even read your thoughts
helioxxx: I dont understand , B is losing points by doing this ?
fanweiqi [8d\]: it may not be good, but
rsun [-\]: b has a grand plan
fanfan [3d\]: Lee is trying to deconcentrate alphaGo
superpal1 [1d\]: its influence
Lilou [1d\]: crete walls dont lose points
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: helioxxx - Seems like it, but let's see
Sweetrip [9d\]: as a strong tygem 9d myself, i believe alphago is decisively stronger than top pros now
feeldabern [4d\]: the right side points aren't important since the right bottom corner is soooo strong
trippin [2k\]: no prior bot experience??
liptos [3k\]: XiJinping haha true, just waiting for Skynet to take over
Matrok [3k\]: blunder or kami no itte ?
Ephidel [1k\]: decisively??
fanweiqi [8d\]: it's got something good
Sweetrip [9d\]: i cant believe i thought i can beat it
rsun [-\]: e13 is a shining spot next
fanweiqi [8d\]: lol
robsclone: i keep wondering about that. could we say that AlphaGo has "plans"?
golgo13 [7k\]: chick on badukTV is super cute
robsclone: or is each move considered, on its own

GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone proposes o10 or n10 for white now
GoIngo [?\]: sorry, for black
BobWhoosta [2d\]: rsun, so you think that white will come out intho the N12 area instead of R9 after O10 by black?
DarkRaist [3k\]: Can someone tweet at garlock
adfafdsfaf: p10 some kind of strange asking move?
DarkRaist [3k\]: and ask him to chill out
zavion [2k\]: no, looking for myungwan kim commentary on aga youtube
okiol [1k\]: heather, no reason to think that - they have done a huge amount of commentaries together, and they always seem to get along, this is a big deal, and they're both trying to promote go - and they both recognize that they have different roles
aham [8k\]: no contact!
glasszee [3k\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s advanced american commentary up
okiol [1k\]: one is the host, and one is the expert
pierrot1: no, the one on AGA channel
Kolie34A: 01o
jockey: i think the pros are just trying to figure out if alphago has a playing pattern. not so much to define the playing style.
rsun [-\]: sorry bob I can't see the rest of your sentence
Jumadan [?\]: i was thinking o10 for b
superpal1 [1d\]: even if LSD is losing, he should do it with style

gomathgo [1k\]: so much better than the other one

okiol [1k\]: losing with style is great - but i'd prefer winning with style
jugi: p10 is testing move from sai to akira toya
zavion [2k\]: thx glasszee
IlanKeshet [-\]: was P11 a good exchange?
rsun [-\]: it's maximized already...

BobWhoosta [2d\]: No, unmaximize it.

BobWhoosta [2d\]: Then adjust.
IlanKeshet [-\]: where do i go for aga
rsun [-\]: oh
gomathgo [1k\]: can anyone else not hear myungwan though
BobWhoosta [2d\]: You will be able to see it all.
gomathgo [1k\]: on the aga one
gomathgo [1k\]: scroll up for the youtube link
Ahamay [7d?\]: yay Myungwan

Blindspot [1d\]: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=l-GsfyVCBu0
svgo [2k\]: p7 now?
okiol [1k\]: i'm guessing r17, because it doesn't give away as much strength
Blindspot [1d\]: this is better
Jumadan [?\]: whaaat
Jumadan [?\]: n12
Mars [10k?\]: n12 played.
njs [1d\]: he is setting up for m16
rsun [-\]: hmm it still doesn't work very well

;W[mh]C[Kolie34A: why does he play here? I don't understand
aham [8k\]: need to capture this 2 stone
IlanKeshet [-\]: what account is playing the aga board
LordTushi [9k?\]: And that's where we just stop following Lee Seedol's thinking
js13 [1k\]: Lee will win this time.
Moshudan [3d\]: this is pretty normal
okiol [1k\]: hmm i don't think this line of reasoning is that difficult to follow
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Kolie, this move sets up invasions on the top, pressures the O10 stones, and settles the Q14 group in an area that is more interesting.
blau3: W needs to be a Player rather than a Spectator in the center
fengitreon [2k\]: n12

;B[gp]C[Kolie34A: g4
fengitreon [2k\]: ?
rsun [-\]: some lines have line breaks but others don't...
superpal1 [1d\]: redmond seems stronger than OLSD
aham [8k\]: slow
fluidistic [-\]: LOL
TheCaptain [3d\]: ,
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Because the R6 stones are so alive, white doesn't want to just take points on the right side.
TheCaptain [3d\]: j
fluidistic [-\]: g4!!!!!!!!
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: So who are you rooting for? AI or Sedol? :D
glasszee [3k\]: outclassed
trippin [2k\]: g4 seems fun
glasszee [3k\]: it's over
LordTushi [9k?\]: Tenukiiiiiiii!!!
njs [1d\]: g4 IS IMPOSSIBLY AMAZINg
oldguy [4d\]: nice move for b
fengitreon [2k\]: how is n12 and g4, if on the video it had not been played that yet
fengitreon [2k\]: ???
LordTushi [9k?\]: Where's rsun's prediction of that move?
Anatoly [2d?\]: Alpha is simply beyond Lee
js13 [1k\]: Lee Sedol!!
fengitreon [2k\]: seems like the video is lagging
aham [8k\]: n12 is very nice
fluidistic [-\]: yeah it's 9d vs 20 d
IlanKeshet [-\]: What board is Myungwan ?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Probably G4 is not crazy amazing, right?
aham [8k\]: it's like a butterfly
okiol [1k\]: i'm a humanitarian, i root for w ofcourse
fengitreon [2k\]: and this is the real deal at present time
dangerdoom [2k\]: the captain speaks
rsun [-\]: I only predicted a genius move 10 s before alpha played p10

Kolie34A: tough game
Sweetrip [9d\]: where is ke jie commentary?

LongLost [7k\]: AGA commentator properly respectful, praise virtue.
eatramen [?\]: the link i posted 
okiol [1k\]: fluid, i always root for humans!
BobWhoosta [2d\]: G4 is forcing, but is it aji keshi?
Jumadan [?\]: f5?

Sweetrip [9d\]: is ke jie commentating in text, or...?
hondra [1d?\]: no, on tv
Kolie34A: the same link......
Moshudan [3d\]: if b were human, i would say he shows a lot of self-confidence. You need some to play g4 and p10
Sigrosa [7k\]: lee sedol nodded before that move like he understood or was satisfied with the board
eatramen [?\]: no, he is talking, he has a board 
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: If you let AlphaGo win now, He will be more lenient to us later

threeoone [?\]: hmm
KobeGote [6k?\]: Has anybody found any live Japanese commentary?

njs [1d\]: white is SO GODANG OP
okiol [1k\]: fluid, i understand, but i don't agree... GO LEE!
eatramen [?\]: same link hondra
GoIngo [?\]: yes, AlphaGo is not a child of fear
trippin [2k\]: I wish had three brains, so I could listen to both commentaries and read KGS chat at the same time
Sakka [4k\]: jh
ranyee [3k\]: looks like b's territory only on top, b's center is open and low territory also
Tictactoe [-\]: please refrain from to much talk, thus players can find these website links easier
cxcv: The top pros seem finding P10, G4 ridiculous
fluidistic [-\]: h4 or h3 here?
Kolie34A: great center for black?
Eggplant [2d\]: anyone else feel that board is too high hard for Lee to get a birds eye view. is that normal. This kind of thing would drive me bonkers
Ahamay [7d?\]: here we go
manta [3d\]: tenuki 
feeldabern [4d\]: d6
feeldabern [4d\]: here we go
shashwat [7k?\]: d6 played
rsun [-\]: after game 1, I know top pros' opinion don't matter
]
;B[dn]C[BobWhoosta [2d\]: I like G3 for white.  I thought E6 at first, but it seem submissive, and black can tenuki.
Madzilla [1d?\]: B is still playing strong moves, so it doesn't believe it's winning yet...
fluidistic [-\]: wow 
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Black will play around K12/L12 area now?
njs [1d\]: d6
njs [1d\]: omg
Azal [2d\]: ready to fight
USSRMan [3d\]: lee sedol loves these games
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Oh no black played D6
fluidistic [-\]: time to sweat for se dol
Jumadan [?\]: now its getting funny
njs [1d\]: Did Lee sedol not consider d6
cxcv: D6 says, 'ready to fight?, dude?'
njs [1d\]: Omg
Kolie34A: oh
fluidistic [-\]: g3 group so weak
Azal [2d\]: I don't like d6
gogonuts [4d\]: d6 confident or desperate? so hard to tell with bots
Eternal6k [6k?\]: Njs lol
oldguy [4d\]: this game looks more vigorous than game 1 to me
fluidistic [-\]: g3 is almost dead?
threeoone [?\]: wow ... soooo ... heavy ;-)
Ahamay [7d?\]: G5 now?
blau3: W can E7, but B gets three kikashis for this
Azal [2d\]: this game looks deeper 
superpal1 [1d\]: h4
Ahamay [7d?\]: or maybe just H4
bababobo [1d?\]: i think o7 again becomes interesting for w
GoIngo [?\]: crazystone beliees 50 %
LordTushi [9k?\]: this game is very interesting
threeoone [?\]: take all play h4 nidan bane W
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: njs - Lee Sedol is probably not concentrating on the game, and is more worried about what life will be like toiling away in the mines to expand hollow earth space for more AI circuitry in the future dystopian AI world
Ellyboo [9k\]: how long before he resigns and refuses to play another game?
dangerdoom [2k\]: hes not gonna do that
fluidistic [-\]: 180 minutes
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: You can't beat Lee Sedol if he refuses to play
gogonuts [4d\]: if cs doen't prefer the bot then the human is better :-)
Moshudan [3d\]: was p10 a proper way to prepare the center fight ?
Sweetrip [9d\]: 2-0 is the same as 5-0
Sweetrip [9d\]: a win 
Sweetrip [9d\]: doesnt matter what lee sedol does
KobeGote [6k?\]: Myungwan just called AlphaGo rude. Rude is just one step away from humanity enslaving
superpal1 [1d\]: 2-0 is not the same as 5-0\\
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Moshudan - "Proper" is a matter of opinion, but the AI calculated a highest percent chance of success there
Long [?\]: this is a big blow 
Jermelle [?\]: LSD is doing well this game
njs [1d\]: Lee sedol is getting rekt
Sweetrip [9d\]: sure it is
njs [1d\]: Seriously
Uberdude [2d\]: g3 looks rash
Sweetrip [9d\]: 100% win rate
threeoone [?\]: alpha go doesnt know how to win with black
Uberdude [2d\]: lee played it too fast
Moshudan [3d\]: @xijinping : with this kind of argument you don't think  anymore. "The bot did that so he has calculated so it is good"
bababobo [1d?\]: reach 3-0 and it's over
Trevoke [?\]: Folks, if you're going to make snide remarks about AI, please consider Roko's Basilisk. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong#Roko.27s_basilisk
fluidistic [-\]: lee regrets the N12 move now
DonValley [6d?\]: sweetrip vs alphago?
covert [?\]: well, with all the LoL talk earlier, maybe someone's going to report AlphaGo for BM
Rukas33 [11k\]: Oh my god
Rukas33 [11k\]: The shoulder hit was prep for this fight
cxcv: O10: after 97 moves these two stones provide ladder
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Moshudan - The Google dev came out and talked about how the AI prioritizes moves to play in a basic manner and how it's different from how human players prioritize moves
gluiwiya [4k\]: h4
ranyee [3k\]: is h4 possible?

XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Moshudan - A lot of high dans were surprised by P10 when it happened

blau3: W k3 and a bit of magic to make sabaki?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Sweetrip - Why do you suppose that is? If you had to guess?
Kolie34A: white can live
SoloWay [3k\]: AlphaGo is actually the GLADoS and it's testing Lee :)

gogonuts [4d\]: ?
SoloWay [3k\]: Portal 3 confirmed

;W[hp]C[rsun [-\]: which move did aja play loudly?
Sweetrip [9d\]: it simulates millions of variations
Moshudan [3d\]: (xijin : when we saw p10 we were thinking about the right. But it was directed somehow toward the left. That all what i meant when i realized it, maybe i said it awkwardly)
njs [1d\]: Can white cut off d5
zavion [2k\]: h4 and then push through e5?
USSRMan [3d\]: this fight favors white imo
USSRMan [3d\]: but not sure against a super computer
Kolie34A: I've never think of this move
glasszee [3k\]: all this hype about alphago,  h4 is very tactful
Sweetrip [9d\]: and those variations are already "preapproved" by its value network
eatramen [?\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZtZdAaInEM
lcc [4k\]: even Alphago can play 300M games, that's still tiny number comparing to the possible games
Ahamay [7d?\]: I don't like white in this fight
eatramen [?\]: japanese commentary
Sweetrip [9d\]: so you know it doesnt waste time simulating moves at say 1-1
gomathgo [1k\]: it's a combination of deep learning and monte carlo tree search

;B[ho]C[jijii: ladder is good for b
Falcon89 [5k\]: this might lead to a big B outside moyo
njs [1d\]: Yes Sweetrip... that's how alphago works
shabazz [?\]: The pont is alphago not only simulates millions of variations, but also store the result of previous simulation in a network that catches essential information (intuition like)
Ellyboo [9k\]: white dies
rsun [-\]: smoke, this looks terrible for w
njs [1d\]: ^ no he doesnt
zavion [2k\]: w dont need ladder, it can cut off and connect. then b is floating

gogonuts [4d\]: i feel for lee, because i know all bots are tyrants at heart

XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Were computers predicted to beat professionals right around this time? Or were software developments boosting it ahead of its time?
somniferus: no
Iniesta [2k\]: what ke jie is thinking so far ?
Madzilla [1d?\]: the future came early...
hondra [1d?\]: A French student of Remi Coulom's started it all with MCTS
voevius [5k\]: CS guy reporting, we thought we were safe from AI takeover for many more years
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Interesting
indogo [11k?\]: e13?
trippin [2k\]: apparently it was somewhat expected by some of those who were very closely following the field
jijii: a few months ago facebook was proud to beat 5d amateurs
Le0na99 [5k\]: black resigned?
BobWhoosta [2d\]: XiJinping, common thought was perhaps another 10-15 years before computer go could progress to this level.
rsun [-\]: b certainly has momentum now
azblueeyes [8k\]: f11 
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: BobWhoosta - Thanks
Le0na99 [5k\]: white resigned?
Kolie34A: no
Prime [2k\]: guys black resigned
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Maybe go just had way less development from major programming teams, unlike more popular Chess?
elsky [2d\]: you resigned
Madzilla [1d?\]: why would he, this is still balanced
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Which caused go predictions to be off by so much
Kolie34A: no one resigned in this game
Madzilla [1d?\]: that's not really the case
Prime [2k\]: sorry im just being a troll :)
BobWhoosta [2d\]: No XiJinping, it is the problem of the large game tree.
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Once serious development started, the software caught up to the hardware
Moshudan [3d\]: isn't white supposed to be ahead after G5 ? 
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Chess has on average 30-40 move choices on each move.
KobeGote [6k?\]: I heard that positional evaluation is easier in chess because you can count material
TAZZ [6k\]: 1-1 now ?
Madzilla [1d?\]: this is the result of a new (and unexpected) approach
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Go has almost 400 at the start.
hondra [1d?\]: chess is 20 on average
Kristas [3k?\]: ÐÐ°ÐºÐ¸Ð¼Ð¸ Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ°ÐµÑ Ð»Ð¸ ÑÐµÐ´Ð¾Ð»Ñ? 
BobWhoosta [2d\]: So it is exponentially bigger in the options.
BobWhoosta [2d\]: hondra, thanks for the correction.
kaliya [-\]: Kristas: ÐÐµÐ»ÑÐµ
goren22 [2k\]: each chess move, however, is more important than each go move (on average)
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Bob - Right, but go programs got strong years before predicted to become strong
trippin [2k\]: in 2012, some predicted 3 more years. publicly visible progress slowed in 2013 - 2015 until alphago beat Fan Hui (trying to remember this from an article Ir ead)
]
;W[di]C[BobWhoosta [2d\]: In chess, you can basically make a super strong calculator, that sees all the options.
Kristas [3k?\]: Ð¡Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð±Ð¾
Moshudan [3d\]: white very cautious
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Bob - And it wasn't hardware that had a revolutionary leap... so that leaves software improvements
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Yes, but they have found a solution to the big game tree.
Jermelle [?\]: Hm? no fighting. 
BobWhoosta [2d\]: They had to approach it in a far different way.
Jermelle [?\]: I know he's ahead but he isn't that ahead
hondra [1d?\]: now watch b go all zen moyo on w
Madzilla [1d?\]: combining two deep convolutional networks and MTCS in the way AlphaGo did is a completely new idea, and training this kind of compound system is also at the front of AI research. That's why they got published in Nature, not because they beat a pro.
goren22 [2k\]: is it gonna be b13?
BobWhoosta [2d\]: That is why they thought it would take so long.
Moshudan [3d\]: b is good at controlling the flow of the game
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Bob - Oh, interesting, what did they do differently?
jijii: q5 means alphago has no concept of aji keshi?
kaliya [-\]: B F11

;B[pj]C[Madzilla [1d?\]: read the Nature article
BobWhoosta [2d\]: There are a few ways.
Azal [2d\]: w not getting sente
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: BobWhoosta - Or do you have a link to a nice write-up?

BobWhoosta [2d\]: Hmm, anyone have a good link?

XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Madzilla - Is it this one? http://www.nature.com/news/google-ai-algorithm-masters-ancient-game-of-go-1.19234
TAZZ [6k\]: how much time atm, for each player?
BobWhoosta [2d\]: I only have a basic understanding of how it works.

Goceman86 [-\]: 1hr for lee 1hr 23min for alpha

Azal [2d\]: f10 not so good i guess
rsun [-\]: b stones are much more efficient than w
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Madzilla - Thanks a ton, same to BobWhoosta
goren22 [2k\]: w gotta peep at o5 no?
jijii: r11 
Jermelle [?\]: hmm. he played r11
Moshudan [3d\]: "much more" is a bit difficult to believe, rsun
cxcv: black is thin
njs [1d\]: black can ignore o5
USSRMan [3d\]: r11 is thick
Kolie34A: really? r11?
njs [1d\]: What choice does he have USSR
Tictactoe [-\]: Sedol spend almost a full hour on his game so far, alphago played quicker and has 22 minutes more
kaliya [-\]: Yes R11
njs [1d\]: r10 is worse
cxcv: the upper side is just moyo
TAZZ [6k\]: m17?
goren22 [2k\]: so now q7?

;W[qi]C[trippin [2k\]: last game lee sedol didn't make full use of time
Eternal6k [6k?\]: S14
jijii: lee sedol, don't be afraid to attack
Fubini [1k\]: s14 
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: There are two reasons GNUGo plays so many tenukis: 1) Because it is smarter than you, or 2) Because it realized that your unpredicted moves are much smarter than itself and it's hopeless to continue playing there
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Maybe those two reasons are the same for AlphaGo :)
]
;B[rf]C[njs [1d\]: This isn't Gnugo
js13 [1k\]: now alphago behave like a truly bot, there r some move that we could learn from bot
Garp [11k\]: given the fact that ggl bought this compagny because they made an AI that could play well at Space Invaders, and they reused that for Go, does that means that I should play old Atari games to improve my go level ? ;-)
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: But probably the former rather than the latter....
njs [1d\]: What does that have to do with anything
Prime [2k\]: woah
Moshudan [3d\]: good call eternal !
Kolie34A: oh
KobeGote [6k?\]: GnuGo's tenuki's are almost always bad in my experience

njs [1d\]: KGS doesn't 
rsun [-\]: what are you talking about, se has perfected random number generation
feeldabern [4d\]: Alphago needs to improve to reach SE level still
KobeGote [6k?\]: SE is just playing on a higher level. It doesn't understand why we can't achieve its predicted scores
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Robsclone - Good question, probably the answer depends on how they programmed its "calculate chance of winning from this board position" routine

Jermelle [?\]: f10 or f11 soon
rsun [-\]: w aiming at swallowing f8 stones

Jermelle [?\]: The bot is getting busy...
Sweetrip [9d\]: white should play 2nd line kosumi
Sweetrip [9d\]: i never understood why people connect
dfhdff: q5 = r5?
feeldabern [4d\]: myung showed it makes p2 for b almost sente
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Interesting that you think Q5 not good, Sweetrip
blau3: W H6 turning out to  be sort of sente, after B F11
dfhdff: q5 is a b stone
Sweetrip [9d\]: it is good in this case
feeldabern [4d\]: because of r2 threat
njs [1d\]: Sweetrip
adfafdsfaf: If you play S6, then P2 is sente.
Sweetrip [9d\]: but if lee sedol played s7 instead
njs [1d\]: How much you think white is losing by
adfafdsfaf: Sorry, s7
Sweetrip [9d\]: p10 would not be as effective
gejimayu [2d?\]: time to invade
Jermelle [?\]: 3-3
glasszee [3k\]: wow b l12 after this would be devastating
feeldabern [4d\]: after s7 then black has p2 somewhat sente was a reason given
Kolie34A: can white invade on top anymore?
Blindspot [1d\]: g9
danielhast [?\]: S17 reduction is big
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Hmmm, left commentator says black probably sees a way to win and it's just checking all the boxes now... but Michael Redmond didn't really take to the idea
BobWhoosta [2d\]: F11 was pretty nice locally.
cxcv: black L12
Sabbaticus [6k\]: who's winning, by the way?
]
;W[gk]C[mement: where is next hand
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Maybe Redmond believes game is still up in the air
trippin [2k\]: i don't think q5 -> p10 -> p7 was read from the beginning no way
blau3: CHAAARGE
rsun [-\]: time for kami no itte
Kountch [1k\]: Does F11 defend G17?
Moshudan [3d\]: like in the first game, sedol doesn't find the time to invade Alpha's framework
eatramen [?\]: R10 like moe incoming?
kaliya [-\]: W R17
js13 [1k\]: b is in trouble 
eatramen [?\]: *move
trippin [2k\]: more like p10 became more probably after q5 already existed
glasszee [3k\]: leggo g9 
hondra [1d?\]: b is fine
njs [1d\]: Guys
Eternal6k [6k?\]: H7
njs [1d\]: If white can kill this whole thing
Codexus [7k?\]: more like robotto no itte
Jermelle [?\]: bot played h7
njs [1d\]: Its gg
Kolie34A: f9
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: trippin - It's possible, what do you think pros spend 15-30 minutes on each fuseki move for? :)
njs [1d\]: I have a feeling black will play h7
Eternal6k [6k?\]: Lol
trippin [2k\]: perhaps
Sachan [?\]: did a minute ago
Kolie34A: maybe
helioxxx: why does w not attacking?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: trippin - AlphaGo can't predict everything perfectly, but surely it can read a bunch of likely possibilities in different areas of the board and see how they interact, and then make move 1 and 3 and 5 moves accordingly
Eternal6k [6k?\]: Using the force h7.
]
;B[hm]
;W[in]C[Moshudan [3d\]: @heliox : this is attacking
Kolie34A: responding so fast?
helioxxx: yeh i told thta to myself when i published it x)
icecream99 [1d?\]: s15 seems kind of slow
helioxxx: thanks tho
cxcv: L12 go go go
icecream99 [1d?\]: w so strong there
kadoban [?\]: I'm sure he's already read this out, h7 was a pretty obvious move to look at I think.
Kountch [1k\]: All is shape for humans
goren22 [2k\]: h8
Kolie34A: why l12
Azal [2d\]: L12 for b seems huge
Tictactoe [-\]: timing of the moves isn't acurate, i have a cat you know
threeoone [?\]: B winrate 65%
seattle [1d\]: playing 5 matches is a waste of time, if Alpha is at a level it out calculate lee, which from yesterday seems that way, then what's the point of 5 matches... 
blau3: quite a concession for B, this H7. W J6 renders the whole lower center worthless
rsun [-\]: is redmond from the midwest?
]
;B[hl]C[Trevoke [?\]: rsun: IIRC, yes
Herod [-\]: California
danielhast [?\]: Kim says B is okay right now
oldguy [4d\]: ignore ur cat first tictactoe lol
rsun [-\]: great, I can tell from his accent
Kolie34A: still mv77,I thought it was already 100moves
KobeGote [6k?\]: He talks like he's from the midwest
danielhast [?\]: so I guess neither clearly ahead right now
glasszee [3k\]: this is alphago's first bamboo joint in the lee sedol series i believe
Moshudan [3d\]: It is as if sedol doesn't have any use of the top. At least some prob would be expected, in order to do sthg of this attack
blau3: Huh? W J6 = toothpaste shape now
azblueeyes [8k\]: e10 
kdbaby14 [6k\]: this game is too hard for Lee
heather [1k\]: w peeping at both sides of bamboo
josh858: 65% winrate is a much higher win probability than 65%, right?
]
;W[ko]C[GoIngo [?\]: right
njs [1d\]: I knew black would play h7
gejimayu [2d?\]: L5? Why not M3?!
Ilyo: Does Alpha go remind any of you of Takemiya a little bit?
GoIngo [?\]: at 65-70 % things become extreme
Ellyboo [9k\]: ticctactoe, thanks very much for making viewing of tthis game possible. much appreciated!
goren22 [2k\]: will b j3?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: will black try to kill all the black on right?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: This is COMPLICATED
kaliya [-\]: Preparing something around O5?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: All of a sudden
danielhast [?\]: Ilyo, Andrew was saying the same
Moshudan [3d\]: @llyo : not at all
USSRMan [3d\]: alphago reminds me of crazystone
USSRMan [3d\]: or mc bots
goren22 [2k\]: or ignor?
Kolie34A: alphago stronger,for sure
cxcv: The bot seems to have swooshed back
USSRMan [3d\]: leaves a lot of unsettled groups, and tenukis a lot
kdbaby14 [6k\]: AlphaGo 9p
GoIngo [?\]: crazystone nopw gives 61 % for black
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: So... we will probably find out shortly who has the better moves once this gets resolved shortly?
bromeas [2k?\]: alphago  reminds kato
dxxd [1k\]: e14
kdbaby14 [6k\]: next is Iyama Yuuta for kisei title
threeoone [?\]: g6 + g9 both peeping at a bamboo joint, what a bad shape
ruby [2d\]: Zen gives 67
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: AlphaGo reminds me of tartrate :)
Codexus [7k?\]: AlphaGo is about 50% mc
njs [1d\]: Tartrate is a human
njs [1d\]: Alphago is a computer
njs [1d\]: GG not similar at all
lofuchi [3k\]: can't b K5?
dfhdff: the bots always like each other
Zombie [-\]: Tartrate is a god
robsclone: this reminds me of some of my first games with my very aggressive friend
covert [?\]: tartrate is currently discussing alphago, right? P)
dfhdff: winrate doesnt mean much at this point
kaliya [-\]: G9 bad
Ilyo: He doesn't have the same sort of opening, but his use of the center and creation of moyo seems kind of similar..
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: njs - Nobody's ever met tartrate in person though
njs [1d\]: That's true
GoIngo [?\]: yes, they are incestuive
njs [1d\]: But tartrate is worse than lee sedol
covert [?\]: isn't there a solid rumor as to tartrate's true identity?
Tictactoe [-\]: thank you for mentioning tartrate, but the fairytale has ended
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Fairytale ended? How so?
feeldabern [4d\]: we know who tartrate is

;B[kp]C[goren22 [2k\]: b m3 actually is the right move no?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Really?

;W[gc]C[helioxxx: ENFIN :D
Kolie34A: I hope sedol can win
Moshudan [3d\]: at last !
covert [?\]: invade!
rsun [-\]: smoke
kdbaby14 [6k\]: invade that???
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Awesome!
Kolie34A: invade
huni [?\]: Oh war 
Moshudan [3d\]: @heliox : ^^
Kogolo: go for it !
AnthonyC [3k\]: oh
gejimayu [2d?\]: what was L5-L4 exchange good for?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: he does not have support any side?
rsun [-\]: this game will end soon
kaliya [-\]: Go Sedol!
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: WHAT is black's next move??? Standard move, or CREATIVE AI move next??
Ilyo: WOAAAH
BobWhoosta [2d\]: This will be a thing, a big thing, a huge honkin' THING!
USSRMan [3d\]: now we see the terminator side of alphago
Trevoke [?\]: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tartrate
iskatel [3k\]: banzaaaiii
helioxxx: @Moshudan :D
Ilyo: The invasion!!!
feeldabern [4d\]: game deciding fight
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Thanks Trevoke!
Ilyo: BANZAI!
Maneko [7k\]: OK, finally!
gogonuts [4d\]: deepmind board lagging on the aga channel ...
KBAC [2d\]: b e17
Kolie34A: whats their time now?
BobWhoosta [2d\]: This move has very little risk because if we consider the top to be black's already, then white is only testing to see where the aji is.
royu [4d\]: "the transistor reddening move" 
kdbaby14 [6k\]: G-15?
USSRMan [3d\]: so incorrect
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Oh, haha, tartrate is literally Kim Myungwan? I didn't know. What a coincidence
njs [1d\]: Lee getting desperate
lodestone [4k\]: lol royu
BobWhoosta [2d\]: So this stone at G17, may well die, but if he can get forcing moves it will serve a purpose.
rsun [-\]: smoke
helioxxx: lol da response
GoIngo [?\]: what an entertaining game ...
rsun [-\]: d14 - "I win"
Rankachan [6k\]: d14  ...
cxcv: R17 is gaining power
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Wow, AlphaGo thinking hard now!
]
;B[df]C[skillup [5d\]: wow
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Wow, d14.
kaliya [-\]: What!
kdbaby14 [6k\]: wow
Codexus [7k?\]: what?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: this move 
Prime [2k\]: DANG
glasszee [3k\]: b kill all
BobWhoosta [2d\]: "I kill you on a large scale.  Die now in peace, and resign."
Rankachan [6k\]: why d14
USSRMan [3d\]: lol completely counter intuitive
kdbaby14 [6k\]: he tries to protect the D-17 peak?
ISH094080 [3k\]: ä¸å°
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Uh oh. Black thinks it can kill or almost kill......
Maneko [7k\]: G15!
Kolie34A: owow
Moshudan [3d\]: alphago attacking on a very large scale.
kdbaby14 [6k\]: he tries to protect D-17 peak?
blau3: Wow, B afraid for his F8 group. W J6 is really shining!
rsun [-\]: w cannot live locally, and b thinks he can profit from chasing
kaliya [-\]: Protects against D17
gogonuts [4d\]: b bid to turn the center trash into thickness
Moshudan [3d\]: b not afraid. Attacking on large scale is the most ambitious attack
BobWhoosta [2d\]: This is the most amazing move of the game thus far.  Deep intuitive move, and quickly played!
cekalo [1k\]: machines dont fear
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I like P10 :)
Trevoke [?\]: BobWhoosta: what about P10?
superpal1 [1d\]: machines sweat
cekalo [1k\]: they have nothing to lose
Kolie34A: because machines don't have feeling
feeldabern [4d\]: when we see d14 we know lee has no chance
Moshudan [3d\]: true. I mean, the meaning of this move is much more about attack than about defense, imho
njs [1d\]: White loses
njs [1d\]: no doubyt
njs [1d\]: doubg
njs [1d\]: doubt*
BobWhoosta [2d\]: P10 was great, but it was not like D14 imo.
kdbaby14 [6k\]: I think this move protect the D-17 weakness, and it is really hard to W to run to N-12 stones
BobWhoosta [2d\]: It's attacking the G17 stone on the largest scale possible.
Uberdude [2d\]: d14 = you are already dead
Komachi [?\]: does white e10 work?
dopingg [11k\]: biggest largest terrain stone 
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Interesting, BobWhoosta
rsun [-\]: honestly, w has lost this game
Kolie34A: sedol.....
rsun [-\]: in my humblest opinion
aham [8k\]: why he's playing so bad?
BobWhoosta [2d\]: This is where I would panic and play J18.
kdbaby14 [6k\]: he probably under the stress from yesterday
Azal [2d\]: w will live at the top and b gets moyo ?
Prodigious [-\]: how has w lost this exactly
Sachan [?\]: If Alphago thinks shes winning does she just start playing a teaching game?
GoIngo [?\]: a strong opponent lets look you bad
BobWhoosta [2d\]: aham, he's not playing badly, alphago is just really good.
adfafdsfaf: if white G17 is killed, then alphago is amazing. Didn't even respond to that.
aham [8k\]: g17 is good?
aham [8k\]: now?
LordTushi [9k?\]: Myungwam Kim says G17 lives no matter what happens
BobWhoosta [2d\]: G17 should live.  But D14 is looking to make a huge profit while G17 runs.
]
;W[id]C[GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone stable at 59-60 % for black here
Trevoke [?\]: Lee has only seen, by now, 6.7 games by AlphaGo. He might have decided to use the first two games as learning games where he tests the boundaries of AlphaGo
kdbaby14 [6k\]: oh
Rankachan [6k\]: j16 by lee
kdbaby14 [6k\]: J-16
BobWhoosta [2d\]: D14 says "You can't live locally anyway, so I will extend my thickness and let you run".
kdbaby14 [6k\]: he wants to fight to live
gogonuts [4d\]: bansai
adfafdsfaf: lee left the table
dxxd [1k\]: hopely not another attachment fail
USSRMan [3d\]: people seriously underestimated alphago's strength by its october games.
Ellyboo [9k\]: and the building
USSRMan [3d\]: not enough sample size
BobWhoosta [2d\]: USSRMan, that is because alphago is better now.
kdbaby14 [6k\]: Lee'll win if he wins this fight
]
;B[jc]C[BobWhoosta [2d\]: Pros were pointing out bad moves left and right in october.
USSRMan [3d\]: well, it wasnt even playing at its very top level in oct
kdbaby14 [6k\]: lol Alpha Go was like... nah, 
gejimayu [2d?\]: W is busy, B solidifies his territory
dfhdff: its not a fight just w living
eatramen [?\]: alpha plays safe
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Oh, USSRMan, because it was always leading?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: alphaGo was like nah...no fighting, i'm ahead
BobWhoosta [2d\]: So it chose the safe approach, which seemed slack?
fengitreon [2k\]: interesting
DrSFBrains [1k\]: Wow.  Looks very scary for W...
Prime [2k\]: maybe probe the corner?
blau3: W F14 kikashi?
DrSFBrains [1k\]: G17 is very lonely
BobWhoosta [2d\]: G15 looks natural.
Kolie34A: don't abandon!
Moshudan [3d\]: is there an agreement that b is winning ? I don't think so
hondra [1d?\]: b putting on a clinic on how to handle invasions like that
rsun [-\]: lee sedol smokes
kaliya [-\]: I bet that Alpha will F17 later
njs [1d\]: Lee has to live
Aram [3k\]: They trained Alphago from scratch in about 7 weeks according to the scientific paper they published, since those games they've had 16 weeks mroe. Of course it's going to be stronger now and will make less bad mistakes
Ellyboo [9k\]: G17 was 10k stone
feeldabern [4d\]: i agreed with myself that b is winnning
USSRMan [3d\]: d14 was too calm of a response to an invasion 
kdbaby14 [6k\]: will G-15 sufficient support?
Jacksuji [3k\]: AlphaGo was much weaker in Oct. Fan actually played 10 games with it, 5 official, 5 unofficial games between them. Fan won 2 of the unofficial games.
rsun [-\]: if lee doesn't smoke, why is his game smoking so bad
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Interesting break discussion from Redmond
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Stuff you don't hear about often
lemur [9k?\]: The scariest part is that this isn't even AlphaGo's final form
lemur [9k?\]: Lee is playing the single machine version at the moment
Sachan [?\]: the unofficial games were also fast games werent they?
goren22 [2k\]: there is no final version of alphago
liptos [3k\]: ah, yea 7 weeks to beat fan hui means 16 more weeks could mean vast improvement
Aram [3k\]: the "single machine" is 48 cpu cores and 8 GPUs
josh858: are you sure? he's not playing the 1200 cpu version?
Uberdude [2d\]: no he isnt lemur
lemur [9k?\]: There's a multiple machine version that has a 77% win rate vs the single machine version
Aram [3k\]: so not very single...
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Redmond says 3-3 still a big invasion concern
Kolie34A: how can they make alphago that strong
Doli [7k?\]: Its ELO level is over 9000!
Aram [3k\]: and its strength drop something like 6-7 stones if you moved alphago to 1 GPU instead of 8 GPUs, even when having 48 cpu cores
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Wow, lemur
josh858: fan hui played the 1200 cpu version
Fumbar [17k\]: i thought this was distributed?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: it seems stronger than yesterday
Aram [3k\]: fan hui played the single computer one
cxcv: c12 exchange is on the spot
njs [1d\]: g14
LoneStar [3d\]: so dudes whos winning atm, for me it seems b is in the lead like by 4.5 ?
Goceman86 [-\]: whos winning at this point?
njs [1d\]: g14
Fumbar [17k\]: no he did not
njs [1d\]: g15*
Aram [3k\]: according to the paper in nature
Uberdude [2d\]: no aram
dfhdff: w win
Fumbar [17k\]: i do not think fan hui played the non distributed version
robsclone: w is strong base, but not in battle
Aram [3k\]: uberdude, no what?
Uberdude [2d\]: both pro games are with disstributed
Tictactoe [-\]: guys please refrain from spam-messages, there are many lectures online available about alphago
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Goceman - People say the AI is winning, but Sedol is smart too and it isn't that obvious yet probably
Prime [2k\]: spam
Uberdude [2d\]: no fan hui did not play the single machine one
Moshudan [3d\]: who are "people", xijin ?
dfhdff: keep in mind w has sente this move
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Moshu - People in this kibbitz
blau3: question: remaining time for both (I can't see the streams)?
Moshudan [3d\]: lol. I'm not !
fengitreon [2k\]: moshi moshi
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Moshu - Correct me if I'm mischaracterizing :)
Trevoke [?\]: Lee Sedol 40 minutes, AlphaGo 70 minutes
Aram [3k\]: ah, i stand corrected, you're right Uberdude
Codexus [7k?\]: LSD already used 30 min more than AG
goren22 [2k\]: people in this kibbitz are basically woodpushers, if you adopt chess terminology
farmshare [9k\]: so if g17 dies, then lee loses?
Kolie34A: 83 moves now
heather [1k\]: not sure that white wins even if it lives
Aram [3k\]: So over 1000 cores and 200 gpus
cxcv: ko fight is coming..
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I wonder if AlphaGo can suddenly use LOTS of time on a key move or not.
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Yes goren, and hopefully we will push with somewhat more accurate, more like children with markers instead of crayons.
Moshudan [3d\]: ^^ . People here are fine but i'd like to have pro's opinions
kadoban [?\]: It has before in the last game, used lots of time on some moves
cxcv: the soft underbelly of AI
BobWhoosta [2d\]: One day we will become finger painters, although none will participate in a masterpiece such as this game.
BongoBob [-\]: I don't think alphago cares much about time as it does about probability for a win
Bursar [1d\]: G15 Jump
JohnNothaf [23k\]: there is abyo yomi right?
LoneStar [3d\]: i just dont think lee has enough resources to overcome the series of good moves from this tireless machine
Bursar [1d\]: ~~~~ G15 ~~~
kadoban [?\]: Yeah, byoyomi is 3x60s
jimmyl97 [2d?\]: where is lee
BobWhoosta [2d\]: 3 x 1 min byo yomi.
Bursar [1d\]: ~~~ G15 please ~~~~
USSRMan [3d\]: Maybe facebook will create a rival for AlphaGo

njs [1d\]: g15
Goceman86 [-\]: apple gotta make it
hemster [-\]: fair game would need to be 4 hours each side at least
USSRMan [3d\]: AlphaGo vs DarkForrest2026

;W[ge]C[Moshudan [3d\]: i believe b lost points aroung g5, while white move seem fine. So i think w should be OK
Kolie34A: bot vs bot
farmshare [9k\]: fb's ai is... really behind from what my friends said 
njs [1d\]: white has to live
Kolie34A: 2026?
USSRMan [3d\]: OmegaGo vs DarkForrest2026 maybe
mark: facebook's bot plays on KGS, i thought
robsclone: what is this attack going for?
goren22 [2k\]: in the facebook version you'll have to update your status every 5 moves
BobWhoosta [2d\]: R17 still has a lot of aji, it should be easily reduced, so if white lives here black will be short on territory.
julbla [4k\]: d13
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Haha goren
USSRMan [3d\]: AlphaGo will 5-0 sweep Lee Sedol
robsclone: D13: expected....just, later
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: And log your location using 4-4 Square ;)
hemster [-\]: is Lee sedol the gutsiest man alive?
Sachan [?\]: g16 Id love to see even if its not good
]
;B[dg]C[BobWhoosta [2d\]: J14 seems natural for black now.
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Ah, after this exchange.
LoneStar [3d\]: yeah i think the time remaining for lee would play a very important role for the result of this game
robsclone: ouch
Sachan [?\]: interesting move from alphago
JohnNothaf [23k\]: I bet if the AI had a person that was able to give it some minor direction, it would be great, with decisions of aggression, or defense, or allowing it to take mroe time for a play. A Cyborg player would be amazing
oonicks: ..
Kolie34A: Actually i couldn't see sedol play some very bad move in this game
Long [?\]: alphago play like chitoku
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: John - Maybe a human would only hold it back from its full strength
cxcv: J14 looks evil
USSRMan [3d\]: D13 is so calm 
JohnNothaf [23k\]: that's true as well
USSRMan [3d\]: not worried about invasion at all
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Better than a cyborg, I think AlphaGo should just go full human, and the 23 GPU become, like 23 people all slaved together in a tank
Sabbaticus [6k\]: It would be like the Matrix, man
Moshudan [3d\]: D12 or C12 ? This is the kind of move i never know how to play
blau3: W must feel very reluctant to response -- might even sacrifice his LHS group and go for a trade
oonicks: it is not really fair this is such a short match is it? imho a human needs a few hours to beat immense voltage
JohnNothaf [23k\]: i would think the hane
robsclone: hmm
robsclone: Kim "...don't feel good"
cxcv: c12 seems better for me..d12 leaves B13 for white
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: oonicks - The computer gets more thinking time too, then... and it will use it
BongoBob [-\]: oonicks, the human should just stay positive and in the flow.
LoneStar [3d\]: b14
oonicks: that is what you think but i have seen it does not need its time
BongoBob [-\]: so he can keep moving
GoIngo [?\]: Lee Sedol running down on time

sprouts [1d\]: Hi dad
Ephidel [1k\]: bold move!!!
robsclone: where are our rulings on "relativity-enhancing architecture"
Kolie34A: sedol thinks for a longer time in this game than the last game
oonicks: thx that is interesting
LoneStar [3d\]: haro sonny

Ellyboo [9k\]: google will issue dan certificates in future

USSRMan [3d\]: we will see AlphaGo's talent at killing
AnthonyC [3k\]: ke jie
Jazzman [1d\]: probably g17 already dead
LoneStar [3d\]: michael redmond commentary commentary is a lot nicer to listen than myungwan kims for sure
Moshudan [3d\]: wd8 ? you really missed it, i guess ^^
USSRMan [3d\]: its a terminator that destroys all invaders
BongoBob [-\]: Michael redmond makes for a fine commentator
kaliya [-\]: I'd prefer seeing Ke Jie playing AlphaGo
Ellyboo [9k\]: time to call alpha go honinbo
blau3: now B L14 or K14 or so?
Kolie34A: Will lee sedol get money after winnig this game?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: LoneStar - Yeah....... that's why I'm on Redmond, it's decent commentary and very very nice background noise for the game too
GoIngo [?\]: without semeai and ko-fights white will not survive this
Azal [2d\]: b going for the kill?
BongoBob [-\]: Tengen Honinbo Alphago
JohnNothaf [23k\]: kim almost rambles too much for mw
adfafdsfaf: Kim:Chance of LS winning less than 50/50.
Moshudan [3d\]: Kejie and Sedol difference is so small. Ke jie won for a matter of rules in their last game
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Hahahaha BongoBob
]
;B[hd]C[Trevoke [?\]: I think one of the key differences is that Kim and the ... Caucasian presenter?, well, in any case, these two are teacher and students, so their banter is fairly specific to them, not really meant to be broadcast
adfafdsfaf: H16!
kaliya [-\]: Ke Jie dominated Li Sedol in their last game
kadoban [?\]: Andrew Jackson
oonicks: zen still doesnt play that move;)?
Kolie34A: ohh
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Somebody plays too much chess (!) (!) (!) 
ingen [?\]: why can't I go back over old moves?
USSRMan [3d\]: Ke Jie is not much better than Lee Sedol
AnthonyC [3k\]: ke jie is 8-2 against lee though
eatramen [?\]: lee using a lot of time
dartagaluc [3d\]: I count black 55 , white 38
USSRMan [3d\]: too small sample size
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: ingen - Hit OPTIONS --> "Clone Game" and then you can go back and forth. 
ArcticDawn [6k\]: wow right in the middle of white stones!!
ingen [?\]: thanks !
dartagaluc [3d\]: Black influence

BongoBob [-\]: h4 is the doghead's shape point
ArcticDawn [6k\]: how accurate is SE right now?
BongoBob [-\]: h16*
ArcticDawn [6k\]: SE so roboist
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: ArcticDawn - SE totally wrong
dfhdff: b leading 40+
Ahamay [7d?\]: While Ke Jie is clearly stronger at this moment, Lee absolutely deserved the honor to play first
dfhdff: its right

robsclone: how?

;W[he]C[ingen [?\]: thanks Chairman!  yea, haven't been on KGS since 2004.. had to remake my account O_O

Kolie34A: b+15
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: ingen - I haven't been here in like 5 years. Made a new account a week or two ago :)
TheWolf [2d\]: is there a live commentary for advanced players on youtube? 
Moshudan [3d\]: @profan : yes, i was thinking the same. But b center will get huge

BobWhoosta [2d\]: Such and interesting game.
TheWolf [2d\]: Thx Uberdude
Ellyboo [9k\]: obvious

Ellyboo [9k\]: white dies
robsclone: Kim has good stuff right now
Sachan [?\]: h17 is obvs yeah
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: It must be weird to be sitting at the board with another person, except the other person isn't playing aginst you or thinking or anything... he's just relaying moves from the computer to the board
profan [-\]: what about pro commentary did Lee Plaay a wrong move?
ArcticDawn [6k\]: haha yeah Xijinping 
]
;B[hc]C[BongoBob [-\]: I doubt the operator for Alphago is not thinking about the game.
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Lee Sedol hasn't made any big mistakes this game that I've heard
GoIngo [?\]: sorry, the operator of alphago is strong amateur
Kolie34A: 1K?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Haha GoIngo
azblueeyes [8k\]: wow china pro think w good now
KobeGote [6k?\]: Aja is going to pull a Hikaru and take over the game
Sabbaticus [6k\]: No Go.
robsclone: didn't somebody just call H17?
kaliya [-\]: What if due to a bug, Alpha plays F4
farmshare [9k\]: @Kobe: I hope he does. I have $60 on Lee for the series
Moshudan [3d\]: white has been good since g5's fight
BongoBob [-\]: didn't watch the first game, but apparently when Alphago made a real strong move, the operator did put a lot of extra snap into the move
blau3: Give Aja some blond bangs ;-)
LoneStar [3d\]: a lot of uncertainties in the centre , and alphagoo gets better as the games go deeper , thus i predict this game will bethe 2nd win for alphago 
adfafdsfaf: @farmshare you are going to lose your money
kaji82 [3k\]: can g15 group live ?
farmshare [9k\]: I made this bet in January.

azblueeyes [8k\]: farmshare....how did you hear about al;phago in Jnauary?
BobWhoosta [2d\]: If black E17, then K14?
skillup [5d\]: black is really kyuish
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Because F17 seems heavy.

;B[ec]C[royu [4d\]: i would love to see b e17 here..
Kolie34A: getting the corner?
royu [4d\]: whoa
oonicks: really kyuish it is w -2
skillup [5d\]: lol..
BobWhoosta [2d\]: This seems to be the most natural move.
Anubis53 [1k\]: w in trouble
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Taking the base of the white group.
goren22 [2k\]: w m15
royu [4d\]: this is one of those feelings when AI knows it can kill all
GoIngo [?\]: crazystone giving 62 % for Black now
kaji82 [3k\]: White seems dead
Ilyo: center now?
farmshare [9k\]: alphago was publicized since last october...
Trevoke [?\]: I kinda like Redmond going "See, if I were AlphaGo, I'd play E17 .... Oh, AlphaGo played E17, see, that's a good move."
Trevoke [?\]: :D
profan [-\]: seems that alphago declared slam
cekalo [1k\]: j13
robsclone: ohi wouldn't say dead
oonicks: unless he can find 16 pts f17 looks ok
blau3: Now we have three huge endgames left: F17, R17, and R9 (or S9 or so)
farmshare [9k\]: also the deep learning community was speculating about it since forever
LoneStar [3d\]: dudes , can lee save 1 game from alphago?
Rankachan [6k\]:  Redmond > lee sedol
BobWhoosta [2d\]: F17 gives white a stick in black's influence.  He needs to get out.
ingen [?\]: AlphaGo is watching Redmond and using his moves
BobWhoosta [2d\]: So K14 area looks best.
Ellyboo [9k\]: redmont vs alphago next
robsclone: lol
Ilyo: Agreed Bob
Ilyo: k14 looks strong
GoIngo [?\]: Lee has to adopt before getting true winniing chances
Trevoke [?\]: You shouldn't underestimate the psychological pressure of being the one in front of the board. It's SO EASY to comment.
kaji82 [3k\]: where did you get the winrate of crazystone ?
BigDoug [-\]: that's correct Trevoke
Trevoke [?\]: "so easy" is relative. I'd look like a baboon if I had to do 1/10 of what Redmond is doing
GoIngo [?\]: I have crazy stone running
goren22 [2k\]: who does he need to adopt?  a cambodian baby?
GoIngo [?\]: on my laptop
kaji82 [3k\]: ok
Reym [-\]: let's say it's much easier
Ilyo: g12 played
GoIngo [?\]: he has to adopt to specific bot weaknesses

;W[gh]C[goren22 [2k\]: adApt
USSRMan [3d\]: This bot has no weakness
BobWhoosta [2d\]: G12 looks nice.
GoIngo [?\]: ok, right ;-)
Kolie34A: bot won't get tired'
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Yeah, this bot doesn't play like a bot.
aghartism [?\]: check the se now
Ilyo: It's weakness is water USSRMan
voevius [5k\]: But bot might have high energy bill :-)
BobWhoosta [2d\]: She plays like a top pro, with a lot of exceptionally original moves.
Sabbaticus [6k\]: BobWhoosta, what do you mean by that?
]
;B[fc]C[LoneStar [3d\]: how old is redmond san? i think hes been around quite for a long
Sabbaticus [6k\]: It plays like a real person?
annago [?\]: To be fair, in the right circumstances water is Sedol's weakness too.
ingen [?\]: @LoneStar born in 1963
USSRMan [3d\]: nope bot lives in google cloud
Kolie34A: lol se
Moshudan [3d\]: still the way black handled the invasion is worth remembering
USSRMan [3d\]: water cant kill it
farmshare [9k\]: "A computer once beat me in chess, but it was no match for me in kickboxing"
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Yes Sabbaticus, I cannot tell the difference between this bot and a human.
LoneStar [3d\]: thx ingen sir
Ilyo: Sort of Sabb... It plays some odd moves, but they make sense..
Kolie34A: world champion bot
oonicks: counts like 4 6 g12 , its pretty scary
profan [-\]: g12 is good but f17 is game over
Sabbaticus [6k\]: That's pretty amazing
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Except for a few moves, and they all have relevance to the position.
]
;W[gi]C[Eternal6k [6k?\]: Go Turing passed
Slowmotion [4d\]: the game seems already over for w
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Is it because humans are guiding the bot's development?
Ilyo: idk about that slowmotion
BobWhoosta [2d\]: No, actually they allowed it to learn on its own.
Poney [1d\]: Why does everybody says it's over, it looks close actually
Ilyo: White is looking a bit better than before. 
Naphthalin [10k?\]: nice, redmond was so sure w would play g11 that he just left the demonstration stone there
blau3: Now it's W who is going for center territory... amazing!
BobWhoosta [2d\]: They programmed the potential for a neural network, but the bot played itself to learn.
InMedio [10k?\]: could alphago play soccer in a alpha-soccer-team-like-sorta-thing ?
]
;B[ii]C[Kolie34A: but sedol can't mak much on center
leachy [2k\]: i'm sure, partly because it uses a huge database of human games to generate the neural net pattern search parts of its algorithm, ie. it is to some extent a mimic for the reason that it does actually mimic
Aram [3k\]: the bot was first trained for many weeks before it started playing against itself
pCeitin [2k\]: It was a mix between guided and unguided learning
BigDoug [-\]: please stop the random comments and keep the comments about the game
oonicks: in general terms, can w do about the right top?
cxcv: wooshhh
kgsgogo: who is leading??
Ilyo: but Sedol can reduce any points alpha is going for in the center. 
Naphthalin [10k?\]: only 666 viewers here
LoneStar [3d\]: redmon saying b is winning
kaliya [-\]: J11? Looks on a bigger scale
BobWhoosta [2d\]: BigDoug, are comments about the AI considered random?
Poney [1d\]: I'm wondering if W will have the time to play S17
BongoBob [-\]: w still has r17 peep kinda.. but it's a little rough
indogo [11k?\]: black more than 10 points
Ilyo: It's rather close kgsgogo
profan [-\]: if black connects w has chance but if black read out j11 seems nasty
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone does not understand j11: costing 4 % in its opinion
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Wow, black is attacking all the things.
goren22 [2k\]: man, this is scary for w
Sabbaticus [6k\]: I know, why is it wrong to comment on AI in a game against a computer?
Sachan [?\]: michael seems really impressed with this move
USSRMan [3d\]: counter attack?
royu [4d\]: wow, this j11... 
BongoBob [-\]: ouch.
Slowmotion [4d\]: b has more point, no weak group and center potential
Ellyboo [9k\]: black is thinking lee is just hoping for the bell
BobWhoosta [2d\]: This game looks better for black now, yeah.
Azal [2d\]: not sure of j11
royu [4d\]: this j11 is fantastic... so deep
Rankachan [6k\]: j11 = shusaku ear reddening game
LoneStar [3d\]: b has much better feel for centre than any other pros
Kolie34A: I think sedol will resign soon if the game go on like this
goren22 [2k\]: wonder how lee is gonna take this probable loss...
superpal1 [1d\]: he's used to it
Dom [6d\]: watching this makes me feel like beating Lee Sedol is so easy
royu [4d\]: lol superpal 
oonicks: cut it on the head or capture the loose stone
Ellyboo [9k\]: his second must throw in the towel now.
leachy [2k\]: j10 
Dom [6d\]: b didnt even had to read much in this game
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Dom, I know what you mean.
godiva [2k\]: w f10?
BobWhoosta [2d\]: It's surreal.
royu [4d\]: i wonder how Go theory will be in ten years
Ilyo: I feel like black might still have some weakness on the left.
Naphthalin [10k?\]: b is analphabet
Cycling [6k?\]: j7
Naphthalin [10k?\]: *an alphabot
Goceman86 [-\]: man that J11 i would be sooo drained after seeing that move played against me
goren22 [2k\]: also, when can we buy alphago?  I think many a go teacher will end up jobless
Hellhuman [1d?\]: Is b alphago?
feeldabern [4d\]: 2 stone handi next? :S
RyanQu [2d?\]: how much rest time lee have?
candala [2k\]: e10
leachy [2k\]: f10 not sente though
candala [2k\]: f10
m1m [1k\]: j10 is a losing move
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Notice that black conspicuously avoided tengen.
Kolie34A: alphago the best bot ever
yoyoma [2d?\]: There could be a huge trade here...
Doli [7k?\]: 28 minutes
Trevoke [?\]: Lee has 28 minutes left
robsclone: I'm liking this for W
Cycling [6k?\]: hmm k13 on this board
Trevoke [?\]: AlphaGo has 59 minutes left
Dom [6d\]: for sure you cant buy alphago for  long time
Rephos [23k\]: lee 30+ min behind now
wolvie [?\]: 28m for Lee, 59m for AlphaGo
Naphthalin [10k?\]: @ryan: in the first game, alphago needed komi to win, so no 2 hc
BobWhoosta [2d\]: So we can conclude that Battousai's games are in the database.
leachy [2k\]: j10 leans for attacking h7
robsclone: when do we get to buy our AlphaGo plushie ;) :-p
Sachan [?\]: goren22 alphago wont replace a good teacher, I doubt it will be able to do teaching games. There is some merit to playing against an opponent that can easily crush you but that will only take you so far.
oonicks: did alpha go play tengen last time?
Dom [6d\]: first, just think about how much hardware you need if you want to run it
profan [-\]: h9 or similar seems only chance to counter attack black now 
Ilyo: lol bob
feeldabern [4d\]: alphago didn't play it's strongest @naph
Hellhuman [1d?\]: What color is LSD?
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Red
DrSFBrains [1k\]: AlphaGo Studied all of the games played by TheCaptain, obviously.
BobWhoosta [2d\]: White
leachy [2k\]: lee is white
robsclone: \\i think that we'll realize eventually that AlphaGo's play-style is strong but has many weaknesses
Trevoke [?\]: Hellhuman: the KGS game has the info properly configured
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Now white should cut.
]
;W[hk]C[farmshare [9k\]: @Bob: cut at f10?
LoneStar [3d\]: lee gets tired while alpha is gonna get stronger from now
farmshare [9k\]: nvm
goren22 [2k\]: also gonna be fun to witness go cheating at the top levels
Dom [6d\]: anyway its not a teacher bot, but people so many times taking lessons because they are enjoying that a human teaching them
Hellhuman [1d?\]: Then teach me how to find this in the mobile appp
BobWhoosta [2d\]: That's what I thought, but Lee is preparing the cut here.
Hellhuman [1d?\]: Thanks.
Naphthalin [10k?\]: if TTT finds some time, he could add "Lee Sedol (white) vs AlphaGo (black)" in the game title
blau3: W  aiming at both F10 and K10
Naphthalin [10k?\]: because android app users can't see the names
Ellyboo [9k\]: how many big weak groups can live?
robsclone: lol, he called that whole right-corner deal too early, i guess
kaji82 [3k\]: nice move h9 
KobeGote [6k?\]: Aiming to cut off J11?
oonicks: since this is maybe good i would guess it is good not ovcer yet
Ilyo: Yeah it looks like a cute @kobe
shashwat [7k?\]: j9 j8 played
w1nless: who is ahead?
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Ellyboo, generally one weak group at a time can live.
ingen [?\]: Black
DrSFBrains [1k\]: TheCaptain is winning.
profan [-\]: Ã¹
BongoBob [-\]: lee sedol's face after j11.... I can't even understand the emotion that he expressed..
EOC: j9 j8
robsclone: loaded question w1nless
LoneStar [3d\]: teaching professionals wont welcome this machine at all for sure ,a lot of them lose their jobs
BobWhoosta [2d\]: It is very hard to kill just one group.  Two weak groups, and you will lose something.
oonicks: i didnt count in a long time 
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Or your opponent will gain something big somewhere else.
python111: who's leading?
Trevoke [?\]: Hah, Redmond just said "I'm not too sure of myself", examining variations on this position.
kadoban [?\]: It may make their jobs easier as well too though LoneStar, not that I suspect they'll welcome it immediately.
Rankachan [6k\]: redmond > alphago > lee sedol
Long [?\]: when will  we get home pc version of alphago
BobWhoosta [2d\]: LoneStar, I can't see Alphago replacing teachers anytime soon.

Dom [6d\]: lonestar doesnt really understand this topic i think
Jermelle [?\]: tryna make that moyo
KobeGote [6k?\]: Seems like it would be tough to be AlphaGo's disciple. How should I improve teacher? Play yourself 1 milliont imes.
igoAggie [2k\]: After the j9 hane, w could connect. f10 e10 e11 f12 f9 e8 g8 
robsclone: "this is all stuff that AlphaGo is not going to do"
igoAggie [2k\]: Am I missing something?
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Alphago would be your teacher Skynet style, I'm sure

;B[jl]
;W[jj]C[oonicks: b is safe in the centre for now my guess is b is ahead
dsaun [-\]: alphago 56 min; lsd 27
RyanQu [2d?\]: maybe W better
goren22 [2k\]: b r16 now for saftey and the win
blau3: B suddenly re-getting chances of quite some lower right center territory
Ilyo: w is feeling a bit stronger here, but it seems like this is really the only move set left for this scenario..
blau3: in exchange for W's upper center
Moshudan [3d\]: @goren :locally r17 better
kaliya [-\]: W is slightly leading...
j3rry [3k\]: zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
skillup [5d\]: l5 is in good position
USSRMan [3d\]: l6?
RyanQu [2d?\]: the only worry is about the time limited
goren22 [2k\]: yeah, that makes sense.  that stops t16 from being sente right?

;B[if]C[Ilyo: It's been really back and forth it feels.
Trevoke [?\]: j14 
Kolie34A: black is leading 1-5pts
Moshudan [3d\]: yes
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Yeah, L5 for L4 is a really nice exchange now.
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Redmond did a quick and dirty count and had black leading 1-5 points, but it was still uncertain
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: About 5 min ago
BobWhoosta [2d\]: White still has the cut at F10 for later.
kaliya [-\]: I'm not sure about this peep
DrSFBrains [1k\]: ignore!  Go after the dragon!  Go Cappy style!
RyanQu [2d?\]: who's redmond?
blau3: but F10 not that threatening anymore, now that B's F8 group may live on its own
shashwat [7k?\]: 9d professional
marseye [9k\]: I'm wondering if Alphago can be sold for running at a decent level with, say, an Intel I7 as it's core. And speculating about the pricing...
BobWhoosta [2d\]: The peep makes white heavier, but black shouldn't really move out the stones until an opportune moment.
oonicks: called e12
goren22 [2k\]: redmond's like god 
Ilyo: This feels a bit poorly timed doesn't it?
Slowmotion [4d\]: after something like l6 b will close the center 
BongoBob [-\]: Redmond is the 9d commentator on the youtube live stream
Eternal6k [6k?\]: Drsf caps PR agent
DrSFBrains [1k\]: :)
goren22 [2k\]: 9p not 9d
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Why do they have so many close-ups on Lee Sedol deep in concentration but NO close-ups on AlphaGo?
DrSFBrains [1k\]: L7
Rankachan [6k\]: 3p or 9d
Rankachan [6k\]: 9p*
BongoBob [-\]: apologies. 9dan pro :)
DrSFBrains [1k\]: Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!!!
ingen [?\]: @XiJinping2 hahaha that would be great -- just a video feed of the server room
kadoban [?\]: They should splice in some stock footage from WarGames for alphago
kadoban [?\]: That'd be awesome.
Ilyo: AlphaGo is really Jie at home on kgs.
Trevoke [?\]: My favorite Redmond quote is from a US Go Congress, reviewing a dan-game from people at the congress. "See, here, you chose the taisha, which is a joseki so complicated that even the pros don't understand it."
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Haha
Slowmotion [4d\]: first play around m10 in sente
Aram [3k\]: marseye, nope, it can't. Google Deepmind did tests, on a single computer it runs at 48 cores and 8 gpus, dropping to 48 cores and 1 gpu made it loose somethinig like 700 elo ranking points.. so a lot. Apparantly the alogrithms it uses are several magnitudes slower than traditional go bo tones, so they have to have huge parallelism to make it work
annago [?\]: They should have resource usage graphs for Alphago.
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Uh, because AlphaGo's thinking would just look like a rainbow unicorn running on repeat
annago [?\]: That's *like* a close-up.
Kolie34A: where should W play now
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Aram - Very interesting
Jumadan [?\]: r17
goren22 [2k\]: imagine alpha go on a supercomputer like crayfish or something
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Geez, how do pros learn to count like Redmond is doing now???
Ahamay [7d?\]: Any updates on Ke Jie or Gu Li commentaries?
blau3: r17 / r9 miai still looming large, but it still has to wait until later
Poney [1d\]: Very complicated setting here
RyanQu [2d?\]: Not very familar with the western go palyers...
Cody [2k\]: Given google's resources, what do you think it's running on now goren?
kadoban [?\]: Pros are kind of gods of counting ... it's scary.
adfafdsfaf: Kim: Game 3? That's already over. 
Kolie34A: Does Sedol have enough time to play?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Exactly, kadoban
Eternal6k [6k?\]: W sneezed and the board went flying
RyanQu [2d?\]: Guli is on live in Chinese now
oonicks: called e17 i meant to say< 
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I wonder how they practice counting like that
goren22 [2k\]: stated hardware which is nowhere near a supercomputer
rubicon [-\]: omg, is alphago ahead?
SoloWay [3k\]: AlphaGo should write a book, but if it writes, there will be not enough time for person to read it
Sachan [?\]: counting isnt that bad, just takes practice
adfafdsfaf: Kim: I am afraid alphago will win all 5 games
josh858: 1202 CPUs isn't a supercomputer?
BobWhoosta [2d\]: "If Lee only made this one mistake, what does that say about Game 3??" -Andrew Jackson
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: rubicon - It's close, but 15 minutes ago Redmond counted AlphaGo as ahead by 1-5 points... but Redmond said it was still up in the air
BobWhoosta [2d\]: "Oh, that's already over." -Myungwan Kim.
DrSFBrains [1k\]: Counting is impossible... Trust me: I am a math professor.  :)
rubicon [-\]: kim said B ahead?
darkrmgc [3k\]: yes
Sachan [?\]: l7 
Jumadan [?\]: l7 played
kadoban [?\]: My old club's procedure for correct counting: 1) Shutup 2) Count.  But I never seem to be able to manage it correctly.
adfafdsfaf: Kim just thinks that alphago is too good. she will win.
DrSFBrains [1k\]: He played my move.  Yay!!!
bitzi [-\]: the chinese stream said this alphago won against fan hui with giving handicap (didn't say how many)
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: White played L7 already
R [5d\]: l7 already
Ilyo: I like L7
EOC: Kim says scary for both b and w here
Kolie34A: It's quite difficult to win alphago in this game for sedol.
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Tictactoe - L7
hominid: problem of induction is a killer, eh Dr? :)

;W[km]
;B[kl]
;W[lj]C[Ilyo: Oh hot damn!
oonicks: time
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: DrSFBrains - Lol Michael Redmond just said "oh! he played my move" haha
Ilyo: about 20 for lee
Rankachan [6k\]: redmond is awesome
DrSFBrains [1k\]: :)
Ilyo: 50 for alpha
goren22 [2k\]: a supercomputer has like 200000 cpu's btw
python111: W is winning
profan [-\]: big ko in the air?
ingen [?\]: Google has stated that it's quite a fair amount of attrition if they added more CPUs and GPUs -- that AlphaGo won't obtain much additional strength
ingen [?\]: unless it's a ridiculous amount, of course
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Very interesting, ingen
CloD [?\]: up to slowing down google searches :-)
]
;B[lk]C[kadoban [?\]: Yeah you get pretty bad diminishing returns of course for this kind of thing.
hominid: lol. IGS score est: B + 56.5, KGS has B + 0.5. Can we have a score estimator tourney?
cxcv: byo-yomi
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Michael Redmond admits to helping AlphaGo cheat haha
Kolie34A: lol
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: On live broadcast
Ilyo: There is a good paper talking about the stacking of resources in relation to understanding board presence for go, and how it has dimenshing returns.
kadoban [?\]: KGS's SE gets lost on the way to the tournament and ends up counting chess games instead.

;W[lo]C[XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Ilyo - Scientific paper or readable paper for non-compsci?
BigDoug [-\]: no more SE comments please
kaliya [-\]: What is M5 aiming to?
SIscurge [5d\]: this move?
Ilyo: scientific paper @xiJinping
Prestige [1k?\]: what is SE
BobWhoosta [2d\]: M9 is such a simple yet brilliant move.
USSRMan [3d\]: well m3 open
goren22 [2k\]: threatens m3?
lodestone [4k\]: threatens m3
LoneStar [3d\]: o2
USSRMan [3d\]: but kind of small
BongoBob [-\]: SE = Score Estimator
RyanQu [2d?\]: I heard the Korean said alphago played like Lee Changho
DrSFBrains [1k\]: SE = Score eradicator
oonicks: alphago is very compliant i think now i want to see the fuseki:)
Azal [2d\]: remember.. that AG plays the safest win awnser against the oponent, not the best 
goren22 [2k\]: or even m2
USSRMan [3d\]: he plays very calm like lee changho imo
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Is Lee Changho still playing in the pro series?
LoneStar [3d\]: i bet my house on O2 for the next move
Kolie34A: black will win
cxcv: SE= super einstein
bitzi [-\]: ke jie said it's over already, black won :p
kdbaby14 [6k\]: Lee sedol reduces the gap
goren22 [2k\]: I say p2
kadoban [?\]: Really bitzi?
kaliya [-\]: Really Ke Jie said that?
bitzi [-\]: yes on the chinese stream
Rankachan [6k\]: gg
eatramen [?\]: is ke jie's vision that amazing?

;W[kj]C[miai [1d\]: yes storm
jugi: no rasis storn
BobWhoosta [2d\]: To even see AlphaGo play like this, it's so amazing.
Sachan [?\]: m12 
Ilyo: White is feeling a bit hopeless now..
blau3: this feels like two expert swordsmen fighting near an abyss
LoneStar [3d\]: lee should try real amateur style jus to test the machine if all other professional style play dont stand a chance vs alphago  hehe
USSRMan [3d\]: this is overly aggressive
USSRMan [3d\]: black is behind actually
danielhast [?\]: Kim says it's very close
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Yeah, this move is very aggressive USSRMan.
EOC: kim having trouble counting
GoIngo [?\]: crazystone at 65 % for black now
goren22 [2k\]: again, this match doesn't matter.  In 5 months more, no matter the result here, Alpha will be the ultimate player on earth.  Just a question of months
Naphthalin [10k?\]: i hope lsd will do white manego
Ilyo: What makes you think that Goren?
Prestige [1k?\]: i see chance for lee
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Basically, goren
kaliya [-\]: Yeah Goren bud I'd love to hurt Google's ego
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Just like Deep Blue
BobWhoosta [2d\]: goren, this match matters because the point at which the A.I. surpasses all human ability should be catelouged.
BobWhoosta [2d\]: It's historic.
Azal [2d\]: goren it's 1 million match :P
hutian [4k\]: who will win?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: kaliya - If Google loses, maybe Facebook will win
BobWhoosta [2d\]: hutian, it is so close right now...
Sachan [?\]: if google loses now, betago will win later
kaliya [-\]: I'd prefer Facebook :)
goren22 [2k\]: sure, but the ultimate idea - man vs machine - is basically lost for humans with such an evolving and adapting program
]
;B[ci]C[goren22 [2k\]: which accomplished, according to pros, so much in a few short months
BongoBob [-\]: but even machine will lose vs entropy in the end.
oonicks: mayb lee sedol wins, it seems to me that alphago is still sensitive to tunnelvision, perhaps it is a professional affliction;)
kaliya [-\]: Lol BongoBob
Ilyo: AlphaGo is probably getting near the limit of deminishing returns on learning.
Dom [6d\]: the next would be more interesting with 2 handi
BongoBob [-\]: but nobody writes books about the theme of machine vs entropy
Dom [6d\]: next game*
Prestige [1k?\]: deminishing returns on learning lol !!!
goren22 [2k\]: check out neutron decay if you want to understand where it's all going, Bong
]
;W[cj]C[Slowmotion [4d\]: pls let kie jie plays the other games
USSRMan [3d\]: Someday, lee will take 2 stones from alphago
KurataSan [3d\]: b is leading
Hoshiman [2k?\]: Isaac Asimov wrote that
wolvie [?\]: It may be diminishing gains, but gains nonetheless
Ilyo: Neural networks tend to trend downward exponentially, there are some great papers which talk about this issue. 
BongoBob [-\]: will do, goren
Dom [6d\]: or lyama
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: goren - You mean proton decay. Free neutrons decay after like 12 minutes :P
kaliya [-\]: I'd expect B J5 instead
kookkokf: next game alpha go will pass 9 times in the beginning
eatramen [?\]: iyama doesn't perform well outside of Japan
goren22 [2k\]: yeah, proton decay.  my bad
Dom [6d\]: but Ishida would win easily :)
WinPooh [3k\]: Even black holes decay
Dom [6d\]: its about style
Naphthalin [10k?\]: only hot ones
Naphthalin [10k?\]: @win
cxcv: I think 3 stones is the maximum that the God of Go can give to a top human player.
Eternal6k [6k?\]: So if Lee sedol takes 2 stones it mean he 8p or AG 10p?
Naphthalin [10k?\]: why should he take 2 stones? game yesterday was within komi
kadoban [?\]: That's not really how pro ranks work
LoneStar [3d\]: w should play a very good yose game to make this gme close, and lee is running out of time , dudes , this is over
EOC: kim says "hmm.. complicated"
Eternal6k [6k?\]: IF
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: cxcv - That's an interesting concept. How many handicap stones would a perfect go computer have to give the top human for a close-to-even game?
Dead [1k\]: is black ahead
Dead [1k\]: ?
oonicks: funny:) sort of an opposite endgame pointer
Ilyo: What's perfect xijinping?

aitkensam [-\]: can anyone say what crazystone evaluation is currently?
Eilinen [-\]: Pardon, but who is this Kim some of you guys been refering to?
KobeGote [6k?\]: Kim = Myungwan Kim, doing the AGA broadcast
ingen [?\]: Kim is 9p on another stream
Trevoke [?\]: Myoungwan Kim, most likely, the commenter here: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s&feature=live-chat-promo
danielhast [?\]: Kim says it's too close to predict who will win
Trevoke [?\]: oops: Myungwan. Sorry.
cxcv: Assume there was really a case that the God of Go existed and he could see through everything
azblueeyes [8k\]: Elinen , myungwankim is commenting on aga youtube site
LoneStar [3d\]: myung kim is the match made in heaven for andrew jckson 
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Lee Sedol will grow as a player through playing AlphaGo.
azblueeyes [8k\]: 9dan pro
EOC: kim shocked by n10
Prestige [1k?\]: sai
Garp [11k\]: XiJinping2 : I read pro says it to be 2-3 stones
USSRMan [3d\]: no lee sedol will retire because of alphago
kookkokf: yi sedol wanted to retire anyway
cxcv: But the question goes too deep and somehow it becomes philosophical
oonicks: there is a proverb for the n10 :)
GoIngo [?\]: Lee sedol will join DeepMind team
Eternal6k [6k?\]: He's coming to America
usaocean: yeah, hope this doesn't affect his actual tournament play
heather [1k\]: does andrew jackson play on kgs?
GoIngo [?\]: in their preparatin for Ke Jie
Garp [11k\]: cxcv : "perfect game" exists (theorem in game thory, pretty general, apply here).
Reym [-\]: Bob is right
Ellyboo [9k\]: pity to retire on a losing streak
shashwat [7k?\]: this isn't toya vs sai. sedol will want to play more through this game
goren22 [2k\]: Lee will tackle chess and bridge next, accroding to his stament
dfhdff: bridge?
dfhdff: lol
Ilyo: bridge?
Codexus [7k?\]: sudoku
BongoBob [-\]: How about a nice game of thermonuclear war?
kaliya [-\]: Probably Lee could tackle Janggi
Ellyboo [9k\]: Ludo?
goalie [13k?\]: can center w die ?
WinPooh [3k\]: There was ancient Chinese pro who was 13 dan... Can't remember name
Doli [7k?\]: Time to commit sudoku now.
Reym [-\]: alphago will tell aya, now i'll disappear so you can get stronger by yourself, and some will cry
Trevoke [?\]: Huang Longshi ?
WinPooh [3k\]: Yes
kadoban [?\]: Lol reym
Ilyo: "baduk star Lee Sedol says he is off to master the game of basketball"
storn [2k\]: Hey, Lee! Othello waits!
Trevoke [?\]: He and Dosaku are generally regarded as "the strongest Go players yet".
heather [1k\]: basketball isn't fair, there's no komi

Trevoke [?\]: Lee Sedol is down to 16 minutes.
Krithalith: wow lol

;W[nr]C[USSRMan [3d\]: 5-0 sweep and lee will retire
GoIngo [?\]: basket ball has komi: higher baskets ;-)
hemster [-\]: 2 hr too short for human for sure
WinPooh [3k\]: Plus Shusaku and Go Seigen 
Tictactoe [-\]: Dr. Emmanual Lasker indeed
hemster [-\]: make it 9 hrs series then we're talking
LoneStar [3d\]: 5 straight is much more exciting than go
Ilyo: Kim dropped the bomb
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Huang Longshi was the name of the chinese "13 dan", so named by Go Seigen.
Morkrumbo [12k\]: is this their first game?
Trevoke [?\]: Redmond saving face "I did see it! This is just harder to explain!" :D
Ilyo: second
Eternal6k [6k?\]: Redmond says 2hrs is norm for modern go
storn [2k\]: 6.5cm komi
ingen [?\]: Komi is 7.5

LoneStar [3d\]: i bet my cottage on p2 for the next move
Ilyo: "And then he just let alpha go.... do whatever it is alpha go does" ~ Kim
Moshudan [3d\]: is the loss on the corner more than the gain in the side ?
ohiioi: who is ahead ?
Tictactoe [-\]: hard to say who leads
danielhast [?\]: Kim says it's very dangerous for W center group
shashwat [7k?\]: who's the other dude talking to mtungwan kim?
USSRMan [3d\]: just m4

BobWhoosta [2d\]: Yeah, too much unsettled right now to count.

covert [?\]: adin1k: search for AGA Youtube Channel
covert [?\]: and you'll find Kim's commentary
Moshudan [3d\]: trevoke : as much time as you want ^^
Ilyo: Kim's commentary is my favorite.
cxcv: black's critical move
BobWhoosta [2d\]: F10 for white is really good, gets a nice hane in sente to help settle the middle stones.
Becubio [3k\]: this will be the move of b
LoneStar [3d\]: why kim refer alpha s  a female  all the time , its not right
Ilyo: Andrew does as well
Ellyboo [9k\]: becuse she is winning
kaliya [-\]: I noticed that many korean baduk books translated into English, report black as she and white as she
RyanQu [2d?\]: how to settle down the middle area is the most important part
Trevoke [?\]: Moshudan: how about http://trevoke.net/sgf/
ingen [?\]: AlphaGo needs kawaii anime face
dfhdff: ^
eatramen [?\]: it's because of yin and yang
Tictactoe [-\]: You should consider Fritz Lang's old movie
danielhast [?\]: there's a tradition in go commentary of referring to one player as male and one as female
leachy [2k\]: s9 might be a better sente move if you think b p7 group needs eyes
Azal [2d\]: it seems ke jie things g15 can live
danielhast [?\]: (when both are anonymous)
Codexus [7k?\]: Alpha-tan!
kaliya [-\]: M7 is not something I like
Azal [2d\]: thinks*
ingen [?\]: @Codexus LOL
kadoban [?\]: alphago needs to borrow the AI's body from ex machina
Trevoke [?\]: When Myungwan reviewed the early games, he said AlphaGo "felt" like a female player to him

python111: L12 awesome
Ilyo: Gives great pressure.
Elios: i missed last nights game did it go to counting?
jugi: there is miai at e10
danielhast [?\]: and maybe also has potential for a little territory in center?
Ilyo: Elios, resign towards the end
lodestone [4k\]: no Elios.
danielhast [?\]: anyway, Kim suggested that in some variations earlier
crestfalen [1d\]: j5 looks as nice yose
Elios: ty
Azal [2d\]: hope w gets r17
azblueeyes [8k\]: lonestar...that was no comment a gentlemean would make in the presence of a Lady
danielhast [?\]: so it's not an extraordinary move
BigDoug [-\]: lonestar was booted for that
GoIngo [?\]: Lee fightin with nails and teeth - but likely it will not suffice
ingen [?\]: What is current crazystone estimate?
GoIngo [?\]: 64 %
GoIngo [?\]: for black
ingen [?\]: OK thank you
RyanQu [2d?\]: R17 maybe not alive now..
blau3: As for B defending the lower right: imagine the disaster if W had managed to make R9 sente and get both this and R17
Ilyo: You think so Ryan?

;B[hg]C[oonicks: well there was no more point on the board i think yesterday

trippin [2k\]: redmond says r17 for b simplifies teh game, and puts w slightly ahead
Ilyo: H13?
Elios: o.o
heather [1k\]: if w slightly ahead by pro count, it is highly possible that b wins by alphago's count
kaliya [-\]: No way that B could carry a more severe attack? Like G13

Kobor42 [?\]: Born american. Lives in china for a while

gejimayu [2d?\]: Wwill pay there

RyanQu [2d?\]: I'm in Project Management class. Professor give up the class and watch the game with me...
RyanQu [2d?\]: lol

Naphthalin [10k?\]: @TTT: you only missed g13

oonicks: well i would be annoyed by this move , it cost time
Tsuijin [1d?\]: What does Redmond say?
Ellyboo [9k\]: white dies in centre
Poney [1d\]: Maybe w will ignore here and play the top right corner
kaliya [-\]: How much time is Lee taking to connect!
Rinnon [7k?\]: Redmond still says he doesn't know.
Aram [3k\]: redmond also just quickly counted it to be more or less even on board (+komi for white of course)
gitpush [5k?\]: Deep still pretty amazing whatever the result :-o 
USSRMan [3d\]: really white won?
Trevoke [?\]: Redmond says g13 doesn't work

Doli [7k?\]: 7.5
ingen [?\]: 7.5
KurataSan [3d\]: 7.5
Ilyo: Kim seems so confident, but Lee looks very stressed
RyanQu [2d?\]: what's the meaning of crazystone?
kadoban [?\]: Why are they talking about a stream tomorrow? Isn't there a break day?
miai [1d\]: 7.5
feeldabern [4d\]: black has j5 to capture some stones in the center
feeldabern [4d\]: i really doubt b is losing
oonicks: 7.5 he is okish still i would say
ingen [?\]: @kadoban tomorrow is rest day for the human
ausrussell [4k\]: I wish Redmond had a real Go player to talk to
Naphthalin [10k?\]: lsd didn't play g13 yet?
icecream99 [1d?\]: j5 j4,no capture
USSRMan [3d\]: game is very very close
gitpush [5k?\]: If it is even before yose it will be hard for Lee 
SIscurge [5d\]: Kim didn't say w win by komi
SIscurge [5d\]: The idea was w can win by half point because its 7.5
kadoban [?\]: Yeah I don't understand what AJis talking about with the scheduling ...
oonicks: no but by my last count with 3.5 uh:)
GoIngo [?\]: maybe very close in score, but not in %
heather [1k\]: russell, Chris seems to be an ok player but I think he is gushing too much at Redmond and trying to tailor the commentary for beginners too much
lodestone [4k\]: Kim said W wins because of the komi.
USSRMan [3d\]: well what is %?
ingen [?\]: they need side by side Lee and Computer 
ingen [?\]: staring at each other
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Are we moving into yose right about now?
GoIngo [?\]: winning percent of monte carlo tree search
oonicks: its not decided
lodestone [4k\]: But did someone say Ke Jie claims B is way ahead?
USSRMan [3d\]: sure do you know the current %
RyanQu [2d?\]: Lee have how much time rest?
About11kyu: li running out of time
Kolie34A: what is sedol thinking now?
DarkRaist [3k\]: Anybody watching teh chinese stream? What is Ke Jie's read?
oonicks: mayb it is , but i dont think it si
Ilyo: about ten mins ryan
HeartXiao [4k\]: Kim said W is ahead because chinese rules are 7.5 komi as opposed to 6.5
GoIngo [?\]: yes they are running on my machine
bitzi [-\]: yes the ke jie stream is quite certain black won
ausrussell [4k\]: Yes Heather, I am being harsh.... I've just heard Korean commentators seem to cater better to all levels
eatramen [?\]: Demis Hassabis was a pro poker player? dang
Aram [3k\]: heather, it's not like go is being overwhelmed with new players, and this is a stream that many people who don't know much about go might be asking, so i think it's quite good it is geared towards beginners and towards explaining
About11kyu: how long is the byoyomi
GoIngo [?\]: 63-64 % for blkack
df1276: computers should be limited to the volumina of a human being on contests
shashwat [7k?\]: what's ke jie saying?
Prestige [1k?\]: i think lee is counting

XiJinping2 [7k?\]: It would be mean if AlphaGo saved some difficult moves for endgame when Lee Sedol was low on time... :)
GoIngo [?\]: Lee Sedol should make more moves for the audience
Kolie34A: 3-3
Shanti [1k\]: Mmmh
Turnipsi [1k\]: all right!
ausrussell [4k\]: cool
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: GoIngo - That's what AlphaGo is doing
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: With moves like P10 or D14
Ilyo: corner huh?
GoIngo [?\]: right, my bot too
GoIngo [?\]: I mean crazy stone
GoIngo [?\]: I am only useing it
kdbaby14 [6k\]: tenuki at R-17
KoyoToya [-\]: Ok i think this is desperate
oonicks: all the rest so miai.. 
USSRMan [3d\]: i dont think giving up g15 for corner is good
oonicks: the right and the bottom

Trevoke [?\]: There is NO chance of this game ending before 3am, is there.
USSRMan [3d\]: alphago is master calculator, it knows what is bigger
leachy [2k\]: 5 junk stones aren't as big as sente

wolvie [?\]: 3x1min

Ahamay [7d?\]: this game Lee really gave his best, and if we can believe Ke he still got smashed... this is disturbing

ausrussell [4k\]: Is tictactoe playing variants?
Ahamay [7d?\]: maybe we are seeing the hand of god after all :)

shashwat [7k?\]: nope. real game situation
RyanQu [2d?\]: I don't like Kejie
kadoban [?\]: No, this is the game as far as I see.
Tictactoe [-\]: i went to the bathroom and accidently thought g13 was played
mcsquared [5k\]: How did Lee miscount?
ausrussell [4k\]: thanks
KurataSan [3d\]: ke jie is currently the strongest player
Codexus [7k?\]: According to the BGA page it should be 3x60
USSRMan [3d\]: g15 stones
KurataSan [3d\]: it doesn't matter if you like him
oonicks: gives lee time to think about g13 seems
AnthonyC [3k\]: ke jie is pretty likeable

KurataSan [3d\]: and k2 
Aram [3k\]: the points around g15 is, what, 2-4 points smaller than this corner?
leachy [2k\]: g13 too small....it has no follow-up moves

baabe [4k\]: for w
USSRMan [3d\]: not big
Turnipsi [1k\]: m12 better than n11
USSRMan [3d\]: r9 bigger
leachy [2k\]: r9 area bigger
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: USSRMan - What is Crazystone?
RyanQu [2d?\]: N11..Not very critical
USSRMan [3d\]: xijinping, use google
mcsquared [5k\]: can lee n11 now, or is that not critical enough?
feeldabern [4d\]: m12 and n11 are coming alive now
leachy [2k\]: yeah i guess bot must think it's winning
baabe [4k\]: r9 is big yes
blau3: can W afford to b15 or c15 in sente?
baabe [4k\]: more than R17
GoIngo [?\]: cs thinks, a win with 15 pointsa for black is within reach now
Ilyo: n 11 is becoming ripe now
KurataSan [3d\]: this game is over though
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: USSRMan - Found it
Turnipsi [1k\]: surely anything threatening the life of k10 is critical

XiJinping2 [7k?\]: The big yose are happening now
joh2345 [4d\]: close game guys :)
USSRMan [3d\]: i wonder what alphago's internal mc says
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Then medium yose
Ilyo: white might be fine
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Then tiny yose, and game finished
Garp [11k\]: ussrman: is the opinion of CS any useful as cant win against neither of players before at least 4 stone of handicap ? If it was reliable, it would play the winnig estimate and win always...
Ellyboo [9k\]: white Could be ahead......... but not in this game
GoIngo [?\]: 69 %

;B[bd]C[Kolie34A: black's winrate,you mean
GoIngo [?\]: right
oldguy [4d\]: I am just curious if alphago would get desperate, and how
Reym [-\]: thanks for the link bitzi
Kolie34A: nearly 70...
USSRMan [3d\]: well if we just play random moves, black wins 70% of the time
TheWolf [2d\]: n14 also seems pretty big no?
ingen [?\]: would like to see AlphaGo's confidence in moves, like with Watson in jeopardy
Kolie34A: Is lee sedol in byo-yomi yet?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Interesting that AlphaGo is taking just as much time on these early yose moves as it did on most other moves
oonicks: 5 dead stonesis a bit much
chruluv [16k?\]: @kolie sedol has about 5 mins
Codexus [7k?\]: he still has  5 min
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Kolie - 5 minutes left, live stream here https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-GsfyVCBu0
Elios: imgen that would be nice to see
GoIngo [?\]: cs: 69 % and stable histogram
RyanQu [2d?\]: Q18 maybe the biggest
oldguy [4d\]: from my experience, when bot gets desperate, they would play ridiculous moves
DarkRaist [3k\]: what program is givin the 69% win rate?
Kolie34A: thx
leachy [2k\]: maybe w n15 or so is a good way to defend against the possibility of n11?
KobeGote [6k?\]: It is good for Lee if Alpha Go spends a lot of time reading this :\\
oonicks: b16 is a good move to learn sth to ppl on kgs;)
danielhast [?\]: Kim says C15 might be big mistake
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone, editiion 2013
About11kyu: one day humans will challenge bots, taking 9 handicap against them
oonicks: not very desperate i call it:)
KurataSan [3d\]: i really don't understand c15
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: danielhast - Interesting, I'm watching Michael Redmond, thanks for relaying
DarkRaist [3k\]: thx goingo
mcsquared [5k\]: why is c15 a huge mistake? was b15 better or something?
oonicks: 1 point free sente for the dead stones 
]
;W[qb]C[mcsquared [5k\]: would b15 be sente?
botBot: w seems to lose points from c15
ingen [?\]: Redmond such a baller
BrentoBox [4k\]: behg move. behg move.
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Haha ingen
oonicks: yes it is mayb too slow
Nam [-\]: oh is r18 big?
oonicks: i mean ..
DarkRaist [3k\]: Redmond is way better than what I'd expected
Ilyo: .-. waht
physics [2k\]: What is Se
leachy [2k\]: if w b15 b16, this is better than w c15 b16 is the idea since now black has b15 etc.
mcsquared [5k\]: r18 instead of q18? 
blau3: r18 big due to O19 sente followup
DarkRaist [3k\]: did not expect 9d to be so damn clear and sure of himself
Kolie34A: alphago should respond
USSRMan [3d\]: q19
Codexus [7k?\]: Redmond is awesome, no question there
Jahfab [1k\]: quelqu'un devrait dire Ã  Redmont qu'a chaque fois qu'il devine un coup il doit boire 
dfhdff: same
shashwat [7k?\]: 3x60
GoIngo [?\]: Redmond is really the best theycould get 
physics [2k\]: Do you know Se? I am on phone
Moshudan [3d\]: (@trevoke : did i thank you properly ? I lost my connection right when i answered you. It did work, thank you !)
ausrussell [4k\]: Time
GoIngo [?\]: for us in the west
Trevoke [?\]: Redmond is a caucasian who reached a high rank in a Japanese world. Other people who achieved similar things had to be significantly better than the Japanese to get there
Nam [-\]: w wanna attack with p18?
DarkRaist [3k\]: Can we tweet enough to get rid of Chris
DarkRaist [3k\]: he really sucks
Trevoke [?\]: Moshudan - I hadn't gotten the thanks. You're welcome! :)
dfhdff: se says b+3.5
Aram [3k\]: redmond is excellent for english commentary in my opinion
Nam [-\]: b must def q18
crate [?\]: no no not this game please add time
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Yeah, Redmond is doing a great job
BongoBob [-\]: Redmond's doing a real fine job. It must be a real challenge to discuss a game like this while analyzing it as well as he's doing it
Eternal6k [6k?\]: He's the best
ausrussell [4k\]: Add 5 Minutes
USSRMan [3d\]: alphago's endgame is perfect according to lee sedol
USSRMan [3d\]: game 1
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: His partner on the left isn't terrible either, despite the criticism he got in the beginning lol
Yumi [8d\]: AI's tend to have good endgames
]
;B[hi]C[Nam [-\]: next w q10?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: USSRMan - Interesting to hear, and really not so surprising
BongoBob [-\]: I can understand the need for his partner based on the media presence in the audience
Nam [-\]: oh
leachy [2k\]: he apparently commentates a lot in japan (in japanese)
Nam [-\]: cut
Codexus [7k?\]: time destroying tesuji
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: "I hadn't looked at that move" re: bH11
cekalo [1k\]: omg
USSRMan [3d\]: huh?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: From Redmond
Nam [-\]: b11
Nam [-\]: n11
mcsquared [5k\]: is h10 ok response?
mcsquared [5k\]: or too passive?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Wow, the AI discovered a move that surprised Redmond
ingen [?\]: Anyone understand this move?
DarkRaist [3k\]: wow time to resign after H11
USSRMan [3d\]: if white ignores and p18?
GoIngo [?\]: endgamer
Aram [3k\]: lee sedol with 2 minutes 30 seconds and a possible new fight in the center :/
ingen [?\]: I am ~5k, so no idea
USSRMan [3d\]: is it big enough
nananana: Sounds like most chinese pros think black is slightly more hopeful to win.
blau3: mcsquared: w surely will look hard for any excuse to tenuki
oonicks: probably not with f12, everyone is thinking for white (v redmond:)
Kolie34A: danger?
Ellyboo [9k\]: alphago understands this mov

oonicks: nice heh,, i agree lee is playing amazing
kaliya [-\]: Amazing W answer
Ilyo: Wow
Yumi [8d\]: nice
MofioL [3k\]: magad i though of that move
leachy [2k\]: lee should have made the game time longer.....a bit longer games would help him a lot and not help the machine at all
ingen [?\]: what a swing -- crazystone estimate now?
Nam [-\]: good job
Rankachan [6k\]: k13 is awesome ?
Ilyo: This is an increadible game
Seijuro [3k\]: Lee starting to go in transe mood
leachy [2k\]: or rather not help the machine much at all
GoIngo [?\]: cs now thinks: score +20 +-10 for black
Nam [-\]: k13 so good
Ilyo: It looks like Lee is hitting a groove.
Gotham88 [4k\]: chinese viewer says black winning
DarkRaist [3k\]: any word from kie jie?
USSRMan [3d\]: should just q18 maybe
DarkRaist [3k\]: damn ok
Elios: id think more time would help the AI more
shashwat [7k?\]: black still winning?
Azal [2d\]: i could watch these kind of match every night
Elios: more time to read
KurataSan [3d\]: what is so awesome about this move?
RyanQu [2d?\]: K13 means D15 can connected
Nam [-\]: g12 is support now
dfhdff: b+20 is clearly wrong...
Ilyo: Kie Jie will say black is winning even if white wins -.-
shashwat [7k?\]: Redmond and Kim are saying W can win
botBot: they are using japanese rules?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I'm surprised the AI isn't making fuller use of its time
python111: not much time
ingen [?\]: Chinese rules for scoring
Ilyo: chinese rules
Turnipsi [1k\]: why can't I see anything wrong with h10?
leachy [2k\]: after this exchange, suddenly that looks possible
DarkRaist [3k\]: anybody watching the korean commentry?
w1nless [?\]: chinese rules
Beleragor [7k\]: guys, i just arrived, how is going?
oonicks: oh funny:) 
Azal [2d\]: if AG thinks it loses ... it takes more risky moves to try to win
Codexus [7k?\]: the AI is probably running on a huge cluster, so it's like it has lots of time in a way
leachy [2k\]: xijinping, it's not AI....hence it can't reason in such fashion
Hyaki [6k\]: white do is best
lodestone [4k\]: M12 is a danger after h10 I think Turnipsi.
mcsquared [5k\]: @Beleragor: white made a bad yose move, then an okay one, and now a fight's about to start
Tictactoe [-\]: pretty exciting, sedol fought harder this time
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Interesting, Azal
JBoutte [5k\]: @Belgator : black just did something aweome
lofuchi [3k\]: w's patience seem to profit at the end
df1276: so playing strength will be measured in iso-cpus later?
ausrussell [4k\]: humanity fights back
botBot: if the first match was played to the end.. what will be the result if w didnt resign?
kadoban [?\]: Haha it just cut
Nam [-\]: like w r9 or p18

Elios: USSRMan it was 2 high level humans... but one is an AI here
Elios: if ^

Ilyo: Most pros think white by a little, Jie thinks alpha go is the messiah
XioLyTu: was played
jugi: g10 is pretty big

shashwat [7k?\]: 3x60
Beleragor [7k\]: how moves left to restart byoyomi?
Turnipsi [1k\]: today it's playing sharp and even risky so it probably doesn't think it's ahead

shashwat [7k?\]: per move

XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Gotham88 - Yesterday, vs. AlphaGo
Gotham88 [4k\]: oo
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: if i could id like to +3 minutes to sedol
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I think there are a few more games scheduled the next few days
Gotham88 [4k\]: okay, tahnks. 
skillup [5d\]: the problem is not whether sedol can win but when he resigns
sloy [1k\]: Computer is unbeatable for yose part. 
Gotham88 [4k\]: thanks*
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: lllllll0 - Haha yes.
Yumi [8d\]: maybe lee wins 3-2
Kolie34A: pressure on sedol
Kolie34A: I hope so,yumi
WinPooh [3k\]: Lee can win due to power outage or hardware bug...
feeldabern [4d\]: lee will have to fight hard to win just 1
trippin [2k\]: lee sedol gets a break tomorrow
USSRMan [3d\]: lol optimistic
Mneme [2k\]: hard time for Lee Sedol
oonicks: b only needs to make about two points iut of the whole centre where is now playing
trippin [2k\]: no game right?
USSRMan [3d\]: 5-0 sweep
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: or software bug
Codexus [7k?\]: no game tomorrow :(
sloy [1k\]: Pressure can only be an Sedol :)))

trippin [2k\]: "are you looking shocked?"
Hanzo [2k?\]: xDDDDD
narugo [1d\]: black ahead says redmond
USSRMan [3d\]: giving up q17 stones for l10 stones was so kyuish, but apparently it gives highest winning probability
guest345: lee is not really using his byoyomi ... just play when there are 55 seconds left ...
Answer3 [9d?\]: the exchange Black lost only 1~2 point
Ilyo: HE keeps going down to one second
adancassan [13k?\]: Garlock's face and silence :)
shashwat [7k?\]: black's still ahead
Sachan [?\]: they seem so sad
shashwat [7k?\]: :\\
Elios: "yeah"
KobeGote [6k?\]: Kim says black is ahead as well
danielhast [?\]: Kim also says B ahead by 2.5
botBot: Live youtube video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-GsfyVCBu0
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Redmond "White has 70-75, Black has 90"
Trevoke [?\]: W has about 75, B has about 90 points
botBot: B ahead +10
Trevoke [?\]: According to Redmond
Answer3 [9d?\]: maybe Alpha choose clear way
Tictactoe [-\]: commentators are tired after a 4 hour and 15 minute show
ingen [?\]: bad mistake in end?
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: score estimator says sedol wins 4.5
lofuchi [3k\]: perhaps if it is other pros they would have resigned already, but not Lee
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: yay!!!!
fx03 [2k\]: Who is alpha b or
Gotham88 [4k\]: w winning?
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: I'm tired, too! It's 3:13am here

MrGimbap [11k?\]: 6 pm for me :)
InMedio [10k?\]: to get lucky ?
Answer3 [9d?\]: I think Black is alead 1.5~2.5 point
JBoutte [5k\]: @Trevoke : same fight here :)
Sachan [?\]: alphago will only get better so yeah..
mcsquared [5k\]: To anybody who might be taking score estimator seriously: Please don't, it's seriously so off.
ingen [?\]: hopefully AlphaGo has problem with byoyomi
ausrussell [4k\]: time for bed
USSRMan [3d\]: so where was white's mistake?

kaliya [-\]: You forgot A5 B7

Aram [3k\]: i hope lee sedol wins at least one :/
dfhdff: w loses even with sente
Kolie34A: Go sedol
Ilyo: idk if I should be excited or sad..
dfhdff: its not close
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: USSRMan - Suboptimal fuseki or incorrect strategic decisions in early and mid-game
Ilyo: Sedol you can do it!
Nam [-\]: d16
ingen [?\]: hm, maybe 4 hour time control next time would be good?  or better for computer still?
zavion [2k\]: b+3
WinPooh [3k\]: What happened, Lee? You promised to win 5-0
Yumi [8d\]: this is so disheartening
Sachan [?\]: USSRMan Michael thinks the l11 exchange is what killed sedol or at least thats what he's talking about now
goren22 [2k\]: .

RedLeaf [5d\]: i think B+13.5
Seijuro [3k\]: It would be funny that AlphaGo is just so ahead that all the not optimal move it plays is just "ok in fact I don't care"
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: thanks chris
gitpush [5k?\]: It is no big deal, IA have become better than actual humans, someday we will find our heroe :-) 
KobeGote [6k?\]: I think that it's worth pushing AlphaGo into Byo-Yomi to test their time management :P
ingen [?\]: yes... like, maybe Lee's move in top right, AlphaGo expected it
eatramen [?\]: actually a day before the match, lee was way less confident after learning about how alphago works
Hanzo [2k?\]: It's so sad ;(
Ilyo: I think it's around B+4.5 with komi
Elios: Google programed it to not win by to much >.>
RedLeaf [5d\]: not possible for 4.55
Kolie34A: pressure on sedol...
hemster [-\]: don't be sad, human needs more time, thats it
RedLeaf [5d\]: 4.5*
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Lee is still using ALL 59.9 seconds of his byo-yomi periods
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: lee should have insisted on like 20 unofficial games so he could get a sense of how computer plays
Codexus [7k?\]: eatramen, he didn't research that earlier?
rs220675 [2d\]: i hope alphago really brings it down to .5 - owning sedol...and he probably doesn't realize it^^

narugo [1d\]: redmond very  good commentator
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: gogonuts - In what way?
Madzilla [1d?\]: yes, because this game Lee played good and still lost

JBoutte [5k\]: No Red, don't say utopic things like that :p

axonn: its about 1.000.000 dollar! ofc he is not immune to pressure when it comes to that much cash
gogonuts [4d\]: d10 and s15 were too soft in retrospect

AndEdhel [4k\]: maybe our best bet would now be iyala yuta and a 8h game?
hemster [-\]: yea because computer play perfect end game 
Garp [11k\]: That's sad for Lee, and really incredible for Deepmind.
crate [?\]: Sedol won 
fx03 [2k\]: Sai was computer program at all
fx03 [2k\]: Fam
fx03 [2k\]: Dam
mogoyo: post match on youtube
hemster [-\]: its like Lee Changho x100
adancassan [13k?\]: Thanks Tictactoe and everyone for this nice "party"!
guest345: AlphaGo vs. Iyama Yuta in a 2day per game Jubango would be nice
Aram [3k\]: andedhel, alphago will probobly play stronger on a long game, not weaker
royu [4d\]: best chance is to send SE against AlphaGo.
crate [?\]: why don't they score the stupid game
Codexus [7k?\]: it's incredible how strong go ai happened like overnight, in shogi top pro level has been reached in recent years but it was a gradual increase
Nam [-\]: alphago get 14d
Sigrosa [7k\]: I hope they use this algorithm to help people, it is so powerful
hojyosoun [1d\]: thank you Tictaetoe for the demo
kadoban [?\]: No point crate.
kakamaka: LOL SE vs Alphago
Nam [-\]: strongest of Go
hemster [-\]: 2 hr 9p is different from 8 hr 9p
royu [4d\]: SE will make moves that will break AlphaGo's algorithms
fx03 [2k\]: That prof google can dominante world
XiJinping2 [7k?\]: Yeah, Codexus
fx03 [2k\]: Caution
Gotham88 [4k\]: ke jie
crate [?\]: finnish the stupid score 
Gotham88 [4k\]: is born in 1997
Garp [11k\]: Thanks evryone, have a nice day/night.
crate [?\]: this sucks
Gotham88 [4k\]: 19 years old?
lofuchi [3k\]: any review on kgs?
hondra [1d?\]: i think Sedol should play manego next
rs220675 [2d\]: i hope we'll have a commercial version of alphago soon..then soon we'll see quite some 12d's here on KGS :)
hondra [1d?\]: oh wait he'll be black
InMedio [10k?\]: bye everyone !
fx03 [2k\]: No need to finish, obvious lee lost
fx03 [2k\]: Byr
Madzilla [1d?\]: If you replaced AlphaGo's value network with SE, Lee Sedol could probably beat it ;)
gobanhh: the next game is the day after tomorrow?
fx03 [2k\]: Bye
wry [3d\]: the press conference will be about disabling aplhago easy mode for next games, and let it play full power
Gotham88 [4k\]: https://gogameguru.com/go-commentary-ke-jie-vs-kang-dongyun-20th-lg-cup/
gobanhh: at he same hour?
JBoutte [5k\]: Nice to have shared it with you folks :)
eatramen [?\]: ke jie doesnt look phased at all
narugo [1d\]: lee needs to start K10 next game
Codexus [7k?\]: Also in shogi it's not even clear that computers are stronger since there hasn't been a match between a current title holder and  computers
fx03 [2k\]: Wry, are u kidding?
crate [?\]: redmond said the official would score the Goban
Answer3 [9d?\]: I'm pretty sure paradigm of go will be tottaly chcanged form today
Bruno [1d\]: black is leading :( 
Codexus [7k?\]: I would still like to see Ponanza vs Habu
Aram [3k\]: Go AI has not happened over night. A team of brilliant reasearches created Alphago with huge cash reserves from Google, building upon probobly 10 years worth of research of other brilliant researchers, probobly easily thousands if not 10.000 people behind Alphago.. saying that Lee Sedol lost to one software team or engineer is a gross misunderstanding. Also Alphago works on over 1000 CPU cores and over 200 GPUs, it's incredible weak with 48 cpu cores and 1 GPU for example.. just stuff worth remembering before going all doom and gloom. Desktop computers won't reach Alphagos strength for another 10 years probobly. The search algorithms according to googles paper demands huge parallelism to work at all, since they are much slower than normal ones.
Codexus [7k?\]: that would settle it
fx03 [2k\]: Hwhat
crate [?\]:  they just leave it un finnished and say see ya later
kafkaesque [-\]: Lee Sedol resigned, so no scoreing, crate
fx03 [2k\]: Human go soul is destroied
hemster [-\]: no chance against bot if not leading into end game.
Madzilla [1d?\]: it's not "Increadibly weak" with 48 CPU cores - read their paper before you say things like that
royu [4d\]: you're making it sound as if Lee Sedol improved independently too Aram
crate [?\]: even with resign look at the goban
Aram [3k\]: Madzilla i did
kadoban [?\]: The way alphago plays endgame is just scary as hell.
JBoutte [5k\]: Is there any saved game here of the first game ?
Aram [3k\]: 48 cpu cores and 1 gpu it drops 700 elo points
crate [?\]:  unfinnished
kadoban [?\]: That was amazing and ... just ... terrifying.
fx03 [2k\]: Alpha go is scary
crate [?\]: sloppy
Aram [3k\]: according to the research paper, compared with 8 gpus
Sigrosa [7k\]: does anyone know where we can see the information we have on alphago and how it works?
narugo [1d\]: sai needs to see this
Madzilla [1d?\]: it's stronger than Zen running on 1 computer
GoRoGoRo [7k?\]: @Aram: *yawn*
asd: it's good study material for endgame
kafkaesque [-\]: click ]))
