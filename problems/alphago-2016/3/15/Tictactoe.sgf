GN[Deep Mind Challenge Match Round 5]PW[AlphaGo]PB[Lee Sedol]BR[9p]DT[2016-03-15]EV[Deep Mind Challenge Match]RO[5]PC[Four Seasons Hotel, Seoul South-Korea]US[Sleepy toe]C[Cilien [-\]: Bonjour
Tictactoe [-\]: Ah bien venu
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Lee Sedol started at A1
Tictactoe [-\]: Today we wonder, was it the sheer pressure of the huge pricemoney, or did sedol underestimate alph at first
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Very clever move
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Tictactoe - Game #5 is a toss-up as to who will win
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Lee Sedol will probably try to take advantage of whatever happened in last game
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Whatever new concept Lee Sedol tried to apply
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Whether it was a fuseki he liked, or some other strategy
Tictactoe [-\]: No matter the result, hope you will enjoy yet another excellent game
XiJinping2 [2k\]: I won't, because I'm going to bed :)
jellyroll [4k?\]: resign!
Euphony [3k\]: It would be really nice to see Lee pull off another win
jellyroll [4k?\]: I hope we see another amashi struggle....
jellyroll [4k?\]: it seems to be the only way!
nestango [3k\]: Lee sedol a ganar!
Euphony [3k\]: so probably sedol does 4-4 then 3-4, then solid play for awhile.
Euphony [3k\]: but he has black... so hard to play like game 2 or 4. hmmm
customgob: Ive been wondering, if Alphago might lose to Mirror go
customgob: itts not a human, so it may not sense somethings wrong
Euphony [3k\]: let alphago build moyo, then reduce or invade
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Will Lee Sedol just REPEAT his moves from the last game? O_O
bryamatt [11k\]: is the game still half hour away?
santiago [2d\]: he lost all his games with b, so probably not
santiago [2d\]: yes, but the stream just started
bryamatt [11k\]: that countdown got my hopes up
geomav [7k\]: What's the word on move 78 of last game? No way to squash it? Redmond seemed to suggest no way for AG but and Myungwan Kim like L10 for AG to kill Sedol in middle...
bryamatt [11k\]: and do we know for sure sedol has b? I thought they were going to nigiri game 5
santiago [2d\]: geomav, it was a nice move but it didn't work after all
geomav [7k\]: he asked for b in press conference claiming it would actually be harder for him
santiago [2d\]: lucky for lee, alphago didn't know the answer
bryamatt [11k\]: ahh i've missed all the press conferences :(
santiago [2d\]: lee asked for b in the last game, to have an opportunity to win with both colors
geomav [7k\]: L10 you mean? Move 78 wins middle no matter what??
santiago [2d\]: apparently there was a way to refute 78
Tictactoe [-\]: yes it should have been ko
geomav [7k\]: Oh okay... I'm still hearing different things
numbaoneee: hi ;)
weaknoob: Alpha might not of seen 78 coming so didn't have any searches prior so made a bad move 
numbaoneee: Lee Sedol NUMBA ONE!!!!!!!!
Tictactoe [-\]: on a chinese website, i found indepth analyses
numbaoneee: someone can say where i can watch ke jie commenting?
numbaoneee: in korean stream
geomav [7k\]: I''m gonna try AGA stream maybe this time...they keep the board on the screen
numbaoneee: link please geomav
Meloe [-\]: hello
geomav [7k\]: rgr hang on
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Is AGA stream the one with Redmond?
XiJinping2 [2k\]: I like Redmond's stream
geomav [7k\]: Thats deepmind stream
geomav [7k\]: disap[pointed
numbaoneee: what
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Ah
numbaoneee: i tried ming stream
geomav [7k\]: it stayed of board for the entire historic sequence
geomav [7k\]: *Off board
numbaoneee: i bet on lee sedol
geomav [7k\]: AGA https://www.youtube.com/user/USGOWeb
geomav [7k\]: I think they say it begins delayed???
Tictactoe [-\]: sorry about that, black probably won't start with a pass
bryamatt [11k\]: "probably"
Johy [8k\]: Please, more tesujis!
numbaoneee: omg
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Oh
geomav [7k\]: Redmond points out how 78 required three moves before hand...setting it up...
XiJinping2 [2k\]: https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzpW10DPHeQ
XiJinping2 [2k\]: NO PRESSURE
geomav [7k\]: If you look at time breakdown...you see it
XiJinping2 [2k\]: How so, geomav?
geomav [7k\]: http://i.imgur.com/3HcJKbk.png
geomav [7k\]: See the time thinking was mostly before 78
numbaoneee: where is korean ke jie stream?
Deterra [11k?\]: Thanks for this geomav
numbaoneee: i remember a website called gfame something
Tictactoe [-\]: A chance of one in twothousand for mv78 in round4, david silver is a nice guy
geomav [7k\]: 10 min then 16 min move
numbaoneee: game*
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Wow
XiJinping2 [2k\]: According to the live stream, AlphaGo actually does have really crappy time control routines
XiJinping2 [2k\]: That seems like an issue the developers would have spent a bit more time on............
Deterra [11k?\]: It sounds like an issue they DID spend time on.  It's a tricky issue.
XiJinping2 [2k\]: "should have" I mean
weaknoob: Also Alpha needs to learn to evaluate it's opponent so it will resign earlier than playing it out so far against top pro's who aren't going to make a mistake
geomav [7k\]: Alpha go plays relatively unfazed by time...same guy made this graph... http://i.imgur.com/XJJgPBO.png
XiJinping2 [2k\]: If you look at a graph of time AlphaGo uses on each move, it's basically the same amount of time each turn
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Just going down slightly over time
Tictactoe [-\]: yes it seemed like alph used a minute a move
Deterra [11k?\]: What an elegant graph geomav
Tictactoe [-\]: even for obvious moves
geomav [7k\]: A guy on reddit posting them
Deterra [11k?\]: AlphaGo's time usage is very consistent.
Deterra [11k?\]: Thanks!
geomav [7k\]: more https://www.reddit.com/user/junkwhinger/submitted/
Deterra [11k?\]: Thanks again!
JeanAlbert [5k\]: gogo LEE 
Azal [2d\]: ke jie channel ?
JeanAlbert [5k\]: Go Go LEE
numbaoneee: ke jie channel
Deterra [11k?\]: Does Ke Jie have a live commentary going that's translated to English?
eatramen [?\]: no translation
Deterra [11k?\]: Phooey.  Not even a text translation?
eatramen [?\]: no
Shinichi56 [-\]: so Kim starts how much time after?
eatramen [?\]: lol
Deterra [11k?\]: Too bad.  Thanks anyway
eatramen [?\]: about an hour after
HandA [2d?\]: yoooo
Shinichi56 [-\]: wow
HandA [2d?\]: let's GOOO
Trevoke [?\]: Kim will start at 1AM EST
darkrmgc [3k\]: People in AGA stream chat were translating Ke Jie commentary
Shinichi56 [-\]: okay I'll watch Redmond and WowLock until then :)
Azal [2d\]: -.-
Winrry [9k?\]: i on kejie commentary now too
numbaoneee: where is aga stream/
numbaoneee: no one is posting links :(
Winrry [9k?\]: le tv showing live streaming
darkrmgc [3k\]: it will start in about an hour after a game
Winrry [9k?\]: google letv
darkrmgc [3k\]: just search for american go association
geomav [7k\]: He had guest appearance by Lee Hajin (3p)  ...She was supercute... She even came up with a variation on 78 before it was played...got Kim working on it before it happened
adoreme [3d\]: is it just me or does the google deepmind guy look like redmond?
numbaoneee: indeed lol
Deterra [11k?\]: TBH I feel like the PROGRAMMERS of AlphaGo may have pioneered a new way of playing go.  If AlphaGo is truly superior to a 9p player due to a different approach, I feel like we should credit the DeepMind team for the oncoming Go Revolution.
Winrry [9k?\]: but its in mandarin 
dsaun [-\]: aga stream, when it starts.will be ///
adoreme [3d\]: he just looks like redmond a few years younger ^^
dsaun [-\]: https://gaming.youtube.com/user/USGOWeb/live
numbaoneee: ty
Winrry [9k?\]: ty tictactoe sensei for replaying
rsun [-\]: is this guy french?
dsaun [-\]: (geomav,long strings break wordwrap)
Deterra [11k?\]: Laurent was his name, no?  It's a french name, at least
Cyphase [?\]: oui
Shinichi56 [-\]: redmond twin :)
rsun [-\]: what about the previous guy
Trevoke [?\]: Laurent is definitely French, Arthur sounded French as well.
rsun [-\]: really, their accents sound very different to me
Meloe [-\]: he speak english like french people :)
darkrmgc [3k\]: yup
Deterra [11k?\]: He's breathing like he doesn't like being on camera.
darkrmgc [3k\]: both sounded french
Trevoke [?\]: Their accents are different, but that doesn't make them less French. It's likely a consequence of the age at which they learned English
Trevoke [?\]: If you hear me speak English, I'll have a lesser accent, but an accent nonetheless.
oonicks: lesson 1 in camera is you have to look at it
royu [4d\]: man, that last question was...
Winrry [9k?\]: now my firefox is not responding well lol
numbaoneee: now redmond is going to the vital point
firefox04 [2k\]: What's this match? 
rustychow [5k\]: haha did the team take games from kgs?
Deterra [11k?\]: 5/5
GoIngo [?\]: good morning, everybody, from Germany
Shinichi56 [-\]: yes from 5d +
Deterra [11k?\]: Lee Sedol will play black.  He has one 1/5 so far.
rustychow [5k\]: i wonder if someone on kgs played that 5th line shoulder hit haha
firefox04 [2k\]: LSD again?  Thought alpha won? 
Shinichi56 [-\]: christian pop do it sometimes
Winrry [9k?\]: hii Goingo...
GoIngo [?\]: I think, the early Zen, back in Summer 2009, played such moves
Deterra [11k?\]: Lee won game 4.
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Lee Sedol played A1 first move O_O
dehuong [1k\]: I hope Lee to play solid style, fighting seem doesn't work
Winrry [9k?\]: maybe someone would use cs to simulate again
Deterra [11k?\]: Fighting is exactly what won him Game 4!
Cyphase [?\]: he asked to play black for this last game after his win
firefox04 [2k\]: Yes but alpha already won 3 games
Cyphase [?\]: because he won as white
numbaoneee: this song is nice
Winrry [9k?\]: actually
rsun [-\]: take territory, erase moyo -- foolproof strategy
Deterra [11k?\]: He seemed to express that he thought AlphaGo was weak against white.
Anatoly [2d?\]: why did Lee asked to play black? shouldn't he play black anyway this game? 
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: so he shiold want to be white again
Winrry [9k?\]: i think lee just need play computer like human
oonicks: the tradition is that during a match they loose the champion is allowed to choose colour once they are behind
TheBear [9k\]: Lee still has to play all 5 games to get paid he gets 150,000 just for that and 20,000 for any games he wins 
firefox04 [2k\]: Not after the Google guys tweaked it to learn from its less? 
geomav [7k\]: No he said AG stronger as white
rsun [-\]: they were going to do nigiri in game 5
XiJinping2 [2k\]: oonicks - Really??
Winrry [9k?\]: lee usin]
(;B[]C[bryamatt [11k\]: usually an hour in
XiJinping2 [2k\]: WOW Lee Sedol passes to Alpha Go
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Is this the Hand of God?
geomav [7k\]: Meanwhile this reddit post has tons of links  https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/49g1bv/alphago_and_lee_sedol_mega_thread/

TheBear [9k\]: Ke Jie has beaten Lee Sedol a few times now....
Wizardry [4d\]: each new generation exceeds the one before it

eatramen [?\]: wait, they said Lee's move (78) is 1/10,000?
bongo [2k\]: Kejie is too naive
GodofGo [6d\]: lee is kinda past his prime imo?
Cyphase [?\]: go alpha, go alphago! go alpha, go alphago! go! go! go! go!
Deterra [11k?\]: I think AlphaGo could stand to be faster in the opening.
indogo [5k?\]: hope alphago won't play bad game
nostalgia [3d\]: but not all of them is considered the best
hkterry [3d\]: 8:2 doesnt mean anything at all in front of Alpha
dehuong [1k\]: Go Lee, go Lee, go Lee
Deterra [11k?\]: I hope AlphaGo makes no stupid mistakes, yet still loses.
rockoac [5k\]: secnd that

Jsnake [?\]: I love this opening
numbaoneee: this is unthinkable
rsun [-\]: Q5 100%
Azal [2d\]: someone with CS?

XiJinping2 [2k\]: Yesssssss new fuseki for this game
zampa [-\]: link to the stream please?
GoIngo [?\]: rsun for president !
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Let's do this Lee Sedol
eatramen [?\]: this guy with redmond is kind of annoying 
numbaoneee: omg, new fuseki
XiJinping2 [2k\]: I'm rooting for Lee now
GodofGo [6d\]: ke jie says move 78 doesn't work
rsun [-\]: lee r5 80%
dehuong [1k\]: p4 shusaku move
bongo [2k\]: rsun is bot 
TheBear [9k\]: I hope with all my heart that Lee Sedol causes AlphaGo to have a 404 error
geomav [7k\]: 1/10,000 is ridculous comment.... because there's only 361 board spaces
Jsnake [?\]: Why is it everyone always plays q15 against me...
Penfold [4k?\]: Will the live stream show the actal board at least half the time this time?
numbaoneee: p4 is terrible lol
Azal [2d\]: lee goign for terr again..
]
;B[qo]C[eatramen [?\]: tictactoe whose side are you on.......... -______-
edlee [1k\]: Please be respectful of Mr. Chris Garlock and Mr. Michael Redmond.
rsun [-\]: bot q4 would be interesting, but I doubt
arcturus [2k?\]: brilliance does not mean perfection - results are what count
mafutrct [-\]: kgs chat is the new youtube comment section?
Deterra [11k?\]: Chris Garlock is a pretty good commentator.  His analysis is pretty simplistic but he asks questions that lead to good discussions.
Deterra [11k?\]: That's his job, and he does it well.
Azal [2d\]: geomav... 1/10000 sequences..
gogonuts [4d\]: b already squirreling away points again :-)
drueknmstr [3d\]: geomav only if spacs are chosen with equal probability
eatramen [?\]: chris just always cuts of redmond during an explanation
]
;W[qn]C[IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: is it ok to respectfully say that we believe that one or the other commentator is doing a poor job?
Anatoly [2d?\]: Garlock and Redmond are doing great!
dehuong [1k\]: p4 is quite strong because the bot doesn't know the adventage of komi
XiJinping2 [2k\]: 1 in 10000 is right... it's what the google engineers said, lol
kaliya [-\]: Wow Lee is so versatile, going for a territorial game
]
;B[qp]C[santiago [2d\]: 1/10k chance of a human playing that move, according to alphago's policy network
rsun [-\]: now I cannot predict
nostalgia [3d\]: actually i think the comments of Mr. Chris Garlock and Mr. Michael Redmond are almost useless
XiJinping2 [2k\]: 1 in 10,000 *chance* a move would be played.
arcturus [2k?\]: i am so happy double komuku
geomav [7k\]: Oh rightI see
Deterra [11k?\]: Redmond tends to go on and on.  He gets very involved and is passionate, but needs to be reined in sometimes ;)
rsun [-\]: q7 again would be lol
gogonuts [4d\]: Lee Sedol wants to send the paratroopers into AGs moyo again
aham [7k\]: f17
Trevoke [?\]: If you think Chris is annoying, please consider that the questions he asks allow Michael Redmond to give excellent commentary in a very accessible manner. His analysis is deep, yet the variations look simple.
geomav [7k\]: AG didn't investigate move because unlikely
kjgfr: q7 p4
Seibe [?\]: 1/10000 is possible when you consider some moves will take a disproportiante percentage of possibilities
braincrash [?\]: saying someone is doing a poor job is not constructive
Trevoke [?\]: He is doing an excellent.
ruby [2d\]: d10 
geomav [7k\]: but why unlikely? 
XiJinping2 [2k\]: I think Redmond's long speeches are great. And Garlick isn't a bad guy either
rockoac [5k\]: why were the first 4 moves so slowly
agent86kyu [13k\]: Go John Connor!  Destroy Skynet!
Trevoke [?\]: ... Excellent job.
Anatoly [2d?\]: All Lee's moves are on the third line so far!
gooooo [-\]: I wonder if lee will do the 1 space jump and if alpha will peep
aham [7k\]: c14
drueknmstr [3d\]: it means 1/10000 chance, according to the patterns it has been trained on
rockoac [5k\]: *slow*

;W[pm]C[Cyphase [?\]: what chance is there that someone will play A1 next? even less than 1/10,000
Blitzbold [2d?\]: paratrooping bot moyos works quite well on the kgs bots...

braincrash [?\]: p4 last time right?
magemax2 [13k\]: also doesn't alphago rates opponent moves ?

;B[nq]C[oonicks: it plays teh shape different from last game with i presume the good reason
magemax2 [13k\]: did it consider it a good move?
juhop [1d\]: If alphago would be conscious in a human sense, it would feel very nervous for this game.
rsun [-\]: not p4 again, alpha...
SirX [5k?\]: heeeej i am 9p
Trevoke [?\]: Huh, let's see what W does now
Azal [2d\]: p4 coming?
gogonuts [4d\]: trevoke, he has become endurable
kjgfr: g17
Jsnake [?\]: I wonder if someone from the future is fighting to make sure this game happens. 
Winrry [9k?\]: hmm not p4?
drueknmstr [3d\]: it rates position after opponent moves, which is sort of the same thing
Long [?\]: i think lee sedol found a way to deal with alphago, take cash and reduce
dehuong [1k\]: if B o3 first, it may tenuki
SirX [5k?\]: ratatatata\]tatatatatatouile

IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: im turning off sound until the commentators start looking at the game position
numbaoneee: is the new joseki
drueknmstr [3d\]: yeah redmond a very good commentator
Kountch [1k\]: AlphaGo Joseki at P4
GoIngo [?\]: just for the record: cs (crazy stone) gives 4 % for black here
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: right now they're reviewing the paper on alphago in nature basically
GoIngo [?\]: sorry, 46 %
rsun [-\]: 4% lol
Azal [2d\]: lol
kjgfr: 4% very hard
Syptryn [2d\]: ON the contrary, I think lee wants white to build giant moyo and then attack

wikipwnia [3k\]: to see alphago play this move is so impressive
rsun [-\]: alpha knows some latest fashion
longbaby [18k?\]: is this the replay of the first game?
numbaoneee: no
XiJinping2 [2k\]: No
Kito [?\]: i heard that stones are not meant to be placed perfectly orthogonally
Julian1d: Outfighting AlphaGo in the early game is likely to fail.
SirX [5k?\]: t19 seems powerfull... psychical pass move
Jsnake [?\]: P5 right?
gogonuts [4d\]: thats from a ke jie lee sedol innovation
rockoac [5k\]: ???

Deterra [11k?\]: Lee has secured some solid corners.
voevius [5k\]: he can get by on human pattern  recognition ;-)
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: w daring lee to invade right
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: ?
Jsnake [?\]: I love that shape
kjgfr: s11
Gotham88 [4k\]: lee decided to play a differnet style.
Gotham88 [4k\]: get solild points first.
numbaoneee: this style is very kgs oriented
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Lee is playing VERY VERY quickly compared to ALL of his last games
Gotham88 [4k\]: allow white to score "potential points
Trevoke [?\]: Lee Sedol vs. AlphaGo: 5 games, 5 play styles
rockoac [5k\]: can someboy explain r15 
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: youtube commentary back to musak
glasszee [2k\]: b is going for another hail mary invasion
Winrry [9k?\]: quick is goo
gogonuts [4d\]: im already unhappy with b opening again
Winrry [9k?\]: good
longbaby [18k?\]: 2 solid corners
]
;W[pf]C[Azal [2d\]: yep.. i don't like b
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: p15
drueknmstr [3d\]: so much for my tenuki theory
lodestone [4k\]: Is alphago taking longer to move this game?
geomav [7k\]: I think Lee wants AG to build something so big that lee can get inside
Azal [2d\]: q10
gogonuts [4d\]: w will make bids for influence anyways
Trevoke [?\]: Huh, W is ... going for territory on the right side?
Julian1d: Getting into a position where AlphaGo *thinks* it's behind is a really good idea.
jellyroll [4k?\]: q10!
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: lol
oonicks: r5 settles wonderfull really handy if you fear nasty surprises
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: julian1d is so right
gogonuts [4d\]: so being especially territory oriented against it is not a good idea
kjgfr: r13
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: once it thinks it is behind ti will throw the whole game 
mafutrct [-\]: lots of bot experts here, great
hkterry [3d\]: Lee thought it seems Alpha plays better in White and he really wants to win one in Black
leachy [2k\]: well i think maybe he figures the bot has weak appreciation of aji so going for territory and then invading later makes sense
geomav [7k\]: AGA streamer thought so... once it is losing it is hard for AG to see value in moves
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Julian1d - Or engineer a situation to take advantage of AlphaGo's bad time management (it always takes the same amount of time on each move pretty much)
SirX [5k?\]: alpha dont think
TheBear [9k\]: Lee may split 
indogo [5k?\]: rockoac, R15 means that W want to take corner, or something like this, i think
drueknmstr [3d\]: seems alphago doesnt evaluate games incrementally
XiJinping2 [2k\]: I wouldn't split vs a super computer. It can read a fight better than me
ruby [2d\]: josekipedia saying p15 bad
SirX [5k?\]: oh lee will split in half
longbaby [18k?\]: Q10!
DemonStyle [3d?\]: I think AG has proven that it understands aji very well.
Trevoke [?\]: Split as in.. q10 ?
drueknmstr [3d\]: plays suboptimally when it has won game, suboptimally when it has lost game, best when things are even
arcturus [2k?\]: alphago learned from 100,000s of internet games...  our blitz games are a small part of its brain.  no wonder it has a weakness
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: q10 is a bit difficult invasion isnt it
kjgfr: s10 go deep
Azal [2d\]: no
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: it studied KGS games
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: so when its behind it will just sit there and let clock run out
numbaoneee: why alphago is taking so much time
otlichna [?\]: is there an AGA stream tonight?
jellyroll [4k?\]: i like q10 and treat lightly.... tenuki after response
wikipwnia [3k\]: i think split is best
wikipwnia [3k\]: but i' m noob
ruby [2d\]: p10 
Trevoke [?\]: q10 is a reduction if anything
leachy [2k\]: q10 not a splitting move that puts a lot of pressure on either group
Blitzbold [2d?\]: why b sahould play now at the only place where w is strong?
magemax2 [13k\]: not my blitz games
geomav [7k\]: aga yes but later
arcturus [2k?\]: when alpahgo learns kibitz then i will be impressed
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: or lee should just not say gg then it will resign out of feeling offended
Jsnake [?\]: Did Lee's brain trust do another study session with him?
K5 [6k?\]: Well, I suppose most of the games it has trained on were more or less level
XiJinping2 [2k\]: arcturus - Be careful what you wish for. After AlphaGo wins, kibitz will be all humans have left
drueknmstr [3d\]: i think alphago's kibitz would involve a lot of trash talking
SirX [5k?\]: like
Wizardry [4d\]: they had a day off
lodestone [4k\]: Computers will never be better than humans at trolling the EGR.
rsun [-\]: p15 only move?
Mazerin [-\]: q11?
gogonuts [4d\]: not the only move
jellyroll [4k?\]: alphago's only trash talk line is : you will be assimimilated
Trevoke [?\]: What is Lee reading?
geomav [7k\]: Anybody see LS start looking at AG's monitor when it started making goofy moves...
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Did you guys hear what Redmond said? Redmond said pros don't like to try to kill their opponents' stones because it gets too complicated too quickly !!
TheBear [9k\]: Im thinking he will split and turn it into an all or nothing game possibly Lee loves starting big fights for big crowds 
Blitzbold [2d?\]: actually it would be very cool to have an alphago-kibitz-comment version
gogonuts [4d\]: r8 or q10 are options too
Julian1d: AlphaGo v2.0 will have a trolling network....
Trevoke [?\]: I may have missed the link, where is the raw stream?

;B[ql]C[cekalo [1k\]: wow
numbaoneee: redmond  the king!!
voevius [5k\]: fight!
XiJinping2 [2k\]: TheBear you are 9.1p now
Azal [2d\]: good good
arcturus [2k?\]: deepdrumpf actually is a neural network twitter .. 
sprouts [1d\]: GG EZ
TheBear [9k\]: Lol
parmenides [3k\]: wow
royu [4d\]: yes! learnt from the other game to not allow q10 :)
longbaby [18k?\]: unbelievable
shinigami [2d?\]: anyone have link for stream?
rsun [-\]: here comes kami no itte by alphago
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Haha royu
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: nice invasion
Trevoke [?\]: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=mzpW10DPHeQ is official stream
SamSpade [2d\]: https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzpW10DPHeQ
drueknmstr [3d\]: lee sedol always fearless
cekalo [1k\]: this looks like a kyu move
MrTortoise [?\]: does anyone know of any more technical analysis than the main stream?
Azal [2d\]: cs update or zen?
Wizardry [4d\]: get him, Lee !
v555777: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzpW10DPHeQ
Trevoke [?\]: I'd like the raw stream where we can, hopefully, see Le's face
ruby [2d\]: p4
BrentoBox [4k\]: Awesome
longbaby [18k?\]: this is a flirting
arcturus [2k?\]: aga stream in 10min?
Julian1d: Against AlphaGo I would not split immediately. ;)
BrentoBox [4k\]: I could look at Lee all day.
XiJinping2 [2k\]: MrTortoise - In one hour there will be another commentary stream by other pros, you can choose at that time between streams
gogonuts [4d\]: I can already see alphago rampaging again
Trevoke [?\]: AGA stream in 40 minutes I believe
MrTortoise [?\]: where is the aga stream? here or igs?

MrTortoise [?\]: cheers shuold of thought of reddit thanks
Julian1d: AlphaGo is good at playing lightly.
darkronin [2d?\]: good rampaging or bad rampaging?
aham [7k\]: bien
royu [4d\]: wow, this look slow?
Trevoke [?\]: AGA stream will be: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s
SirX [5k?\]: err

gogonuts [4d\]: better for alphago
go7734 [4d\]: w followup is o17?

royu [4d\]: q8 or q11 here?
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: s6?
MrTortoise [?\]: gotta say i like alphago style this game
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Huh.... this doesn't look good for white im2ko
Trevoke [?\]: This is going to be very interesting
gogonuts [4d\]: this miserly style is not the answer against it
numbaoneee: what the hell, i was thinking lee sedol was white
kjgfr: b must make mass of tenuki
Deterra [11k?\]: Q16?
BongoBob [-\]: also hoping for non-commentary stream link.
Winrry [9k?\]: hmm why youtube streaming like slower than here
XiJinping2 [2k\]: numbaoneee - No, he is asian
leachy [2k\]: can't be slow when b p15 was a good move the move before
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: is youtube commentary way behind the game for eveyrone else too?
aham [7k\]: r11
gogonuts [4d\]: just because lee pulled off this incredible upset in game 4, doesnt mean this is promising
Shinichi56 [-\]: q8 
XiJinping2 [2k\]: llllllllll0 refresh the page
wikipwnia [3k\]: s6
Azal [2d\]: q8 maybe
Seibe [?\]: hit the live button
Azal [2d\]: but q16 is sente for w
Seibe [?\]: with lag it falls behind
Wizardry [4d\]: what about s6 here?
aham [7k\]: q8 bien
numbaoneee: w has nothing , res in move 150
longbaby [18k?\]: wow a big carnival
go7734 [4d\]: lee's incredible upset only game after falling far behind, so unless lee can regularly overturn the game...
ruby [2d\]: o17 seems too good
Azal [2d\]: i don't like s6 
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Hmm Redmond says "There is no immediate problem with either player's stones on the right"
TheBear [9k\]: Black wont care 
voevius [5k\]: can black just move to r11?
royu [4d\]: my guesses are q8 or q11 
Deterra [11k?\]: When the youtube lags, drag the progress bar back to the front and it will reset to live.  This is a bit faster on my browser than hitting the live button.
SirX [5k?\]: can some DDK hack the alphago computer=
Azal [2d\]: cs, zen update ?
zavion [2k\]: alphago think ponuki is 30 points?
longbaby [18k?\]: reymond is right
Blitzbold [2d?\]: s6 looks as if there is no way it can turn sour later... i like s6
weaknoob: r11 too basic
numbaoneee: its like lee sedol is not even nervous anymore
Long [?\]: i think alphago suck at using influences and thickness
Trevoke [?\]: Does anybody have the raw stream from DeepMind, the one without the English commentary?
]
;B[pl]C[voevius [5k\]: weaknoob, so r11 is bad?
Long [?\]: lee sedol overestimate alphago 
UTDEspy [-\]: I would have a lot of trouble answering that Atari
aham [7k\]: cool
SirX [5k?\]: attack the force
Deterra [11k?\]: I'd like that too Trevoke.  I wanna see Lee's face!
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: thanks now commentary up to date after refresh
weaknoob: against alpha ya
Azal [2d\]: oks nice
rsun [-\]: end of fuseki
Kountch [1k\]: It would not be a ponnuki because of R14
TheBear [9k\]: yup white will answer 
ruby [2d\]: p4 
weaknoob: good normal people
Azal [2d\]: q16 
longbaby [18k?\]: capture the white?
leachy [2k\]: now alphago will surely p4
Shinichi56 [-\]: told ya :p
Azal [2d\]: sure.. it's sente
matroid: It is hard to "overestimate" an opponent beat you 3 times in a row
XiJinping2 [2k\]: "I would find this questionable, actually" Redmond on wP15 at this stage
numbaoneee: redmond says p15 is questionable
numbaoneee: waw
royu [4d\]: i truly believe that if lee sedol had played the bots on KGS leading up to this match, he would not have lost all of the first three
dsaun [-\]: redmond https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzpW10DPHeQ
Cyphase [?\]: whoa, i just got deja vu about this position
voevius [5k\]: perhaps 30 moves from now it will make sense.
]
;W[ol]C[kjgfr: lee vs ayabot would be funny
SirX [5k?\]: hmmm if sedol win this game... we should demostrate for at least 4 more games
Blitzbold [2d?\]: yes royu - i think similar
drueknmstr [3d\]: 100 moves from now, alphago has a long horizon
mate105 [1d\]: Double hane is coming.
longbaby [18k?\]: alpha played well
Mazerin [-\]: p15 is for is for L17
drueknmstr [3d\]: like r7 two games ago
asdfa: anyone have crazy stone prediction?
nu [2k\]: lsd is playing more confident ofc, that 4th game continues here in a sense
royu [4d\]: even the bots on KGS demonstrate the same weaknesses that AlphaGo did in game 4
Azal [2d\]: CS??
Julian1d: I am not qualified to evaluate it, but I think AlphaGo's training may be leading it astray here.
voevius [5k\]: druek i don;t think alphago can look ahead with 100 moves ;-)
longbaby [18k?\]: P9?
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone says 47 % for black here
Tictactoe [-\]: redmond mentions Shuwa
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Thanks Tictactoe, I missed the name
Azal [2d\]: thx goingo
SirX [5k?\]: oh
indogo [5k?\]: what redmond said?
Azal [2d\]: prob. AG feels ahead then
Tictactoe [-\]: all these playersnames can be found in gobase.org
oonicks: this kind of moment i think alphago is somehow aware of the concept of time
weaknoob: Nice to see Lee trying to stop Alpha from a building castle size moyo
drueknmstr [3d\]: voevius we will see :)
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: i feel like black should connect right like s6 and i just a dump 7k?
oonicks: or perhaps complexity form the human viewpoint
Gotham88 [4k\]: s6?
aham [7k\]: p9
Azal [2d\]: s6 is too slow
XiJinping2 [2k\]: AlphaGo is not really aware of time. AlphaGo has not been changed between matches.
ruby [2d\]: p9 only move?
Tictactoe [-\]: amashi
geomav [7k\]: so hane is bending around a stone...Does P4 reply have a name?
SirX [5k?\]: oh
Azal [2d\]: maybe lee thinking of p
Azal [2d\]: p6

geomav [7k\]: P9*
jellyroll [4k?\]: p9 to press, s6 to be calm
aham [7k\]: p8
oonicks: yes they say that, but a sufficiently intelligent pattern recognition wouild probably anyhow recognise it (i think)
Tictactoe [-\]: amashi probably explained on sensei.xmp.net
numbaoneee: p9
TheBear [9k\]: Lee is thinking evil thoughts he is looking for blood I can feel it 
Trevoke [?\]: "Hi! I am Clippy, your friendly Go-playing assistant. It looks like you are trying to end fuseki early. Would you like some help?"

XiJinping2 [2k\]: Hmmmm

Azal [2d\]: c14 seems big
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Surprising Alpha Go tenukis now. Must be really smart or really dumb :)
longbaby [18k?\]: not bad for b
voevius [5k\]: not very good, since it is not as strong as lee / alphago
rsun [-\]: 74.5% accurate
matroid: that crazy move again
Wizardry [4d\]: alphago likes this 3 space jump
longbaby [18k?\]: d10
Winrry [9k?\]: i tgt g3 kinda move usually not good?
indogo [5k?\]:  when we can see alphago again after this
XiJinping2 [2k\]: White's right side is a bit ugly
DemonStyle [3d?\]: Tenuki is required. The only way this is okay for W is if ittakes sente
aham [7k\]: c14
GoIngo [?\]: cs not accurate, but the best bot info we have
oonicks: its behind
sprouts [1d\]: Good answer rsun
Julian1d: I hope Google makes AlphaGo available online. ;)
kaliya [-\]: Alpha keeps going with large knights
K5 [6k?\]: I would not call that complete tenuki - is batural response to erase the new B strength
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Julian1d - I hope so, too
UTDEspy [-\]: Alphago doesn't like jumps with a 'point of symmetry' 
highhand [5k\]: b n9 interesting?
nu [2k\]: is cs something u can buy
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: third revolution of the opening - make many large knight moves
royu [4d\]: ke jie says after g3, he thinks w doesn't look promising

TheBear [9k\]: Will pencer 
aham [7k\]: alphago in trouble
go7734 [4d\]: i don't know that b is leading

eatramen [?\]: Lee iselevated 
Blitzbold [2d?\]: nobody in trouble
gogonuts [4d\]: no, no - lee outfoxed in the opening again
dddwyp [19k\]: GOOD!! GOOD!!
UTDEspy [-\]: From a bot perspective I'm not sure. It makes it harder to find an easy invasion point but I wouldn't expect the pro level to be so bothered
XiJinping2 [2k\]: White stones on right are perfectly safe, not really able to be threatened. And white doing fine elsewhere
aham [7k\]: he's fascinating by q7
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: if alphago thinks its winning % is 49% then it will start making absurd moves
UTDEspy [-\]: It's generally easiest to start reading at that center-point cut
geomav [7k\]: AG's q7 moves...mostly wasted right???
XiJinping2 [2k\]: So probably hard to say who is ahead at this point

;W[fc]C[kaliya [-\]: Alpha will probably pincer?
dehuong [1k\]: now B leading
aham [7k\]: k4
Jsnake [?\]: I wonder if playing a lot of weak players would actually hurt alpha go's fast progress?
glasszee [2k\]: d10 
XiJinping2 [2k\]: geomav - No, because those three dead white stones allowed white to play P9 and R10
MrChips [1k\]: gogonuts, how can you tell he's behind in the opening?
Winrry [9k?\]: i like the way they explain basic terms
bongo [2k\]: i wanna here what Guli says about these move
geomav [7k\]: thanks
Trevoke [?\]: 36k people on the live stream
Jumadan [?\]: is c3 sequence sente for black?
Badduck [2d?\]: I like w play right side somehow - very nice and fast
Nogarod [5k\]: C6 after resolving top left corner
XiJinping2 [2k\]: geomav - Usually three stones is more than you normally sacrifice in these kind of moves though, so it looks unusual
hio: Jsnake> alphabot is able to play games and not learn from them ^^
K5 [6k?\]: q7 stones will also be used as big ko aji
Trevoke [?\]: Loo is thinking, looking around, sitting up straight.. He just moved something.
gogonuts [4d\]: f17 - already nurturing a lead ...
royu [4d\]: they are saying AlphaGo got 4th world ranking after last 3 wins vs. Lee Sedol
Trevoke [?\]: And that was meant to be Lee, not Loo.
royu [4d\]: and KeJie said he thinks the world rankings are not very accurate
aham [7k\]: k16
kjgfr: lol
Nogarod [5k\]: Everyone loves Ke Jie
GoRoGoRo [7k?\]: where is the video without comments?
royu [4d\]: or, not reliable to be more precise
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: barbed wire?
Long [?\]: i think the way to win alphago is to play solid, not competitive style 
Winrry [9k?\]: piles of rocks... barb wires... lol
Nogarod [5k\]: They like the kid
jellyroll [4k?\]: I want to play drunken go w/ michael redmond...   that would be hilarious.
oonicks: f17 is good enough that lee need to reply well
kjgfr: ke jie vs alhpago next
Jumadan [?\]: is c3 sente for black?
Nogarod [5k\]: Ditto jellyroll
highhand [5k\]: KeJie analysis available after game finishes?
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Redmond would destroy you drunk
Deterra [11k?\]: I wanna see Redmond play AlphaGo
kjgfr: would be great to see alpha crush him
jellyroll [4k?\]: no doubt!
Trevoke [?\]: TTT - b16 
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: i want to see a team of pros play alpha go
Winrry [9k?\]: i cant watch two commentaries together
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Same, Deterra, after we've gotten to know him over the last 20 hours of commentary :)

ruby [2d\]: c13 
geomav [7k\]: What's the stone difference from 1d pro to 9d pro???
Deterra [11k?\]: Absolutely XiJinping2
storn [2k\]: Hi everyone! Colors?
Winrry [9k?\]: ooo japanese joseki
Deterra [11k?\]: Lee is b
storn [2k\]: Thanks
voevius [5k\]: alpha go for sure has raised interest in the game of go.
gogonuts [4d\]: geomav, less than 2
oonicks: simplifying another corner
geomav [7k\]: okk thanks
go7734 [4d\]: c17 is super unlikely
Tictactoe [-\]: barbed wire is mostly seen around patches of land for cattle
voevius [5k\]: which is fantastic, hopefully we get to discover many  new ways of playing.
drueknmstr [3d\]: rule of thumb i heard is 1/3rd stone per 1p
hkterry [3d\]: o17 is shining
geomav [7k\]: And how about 1d pro to kgs 5d???

;W[ch]C[dddwyp [19k\]: L3

gogonuts [4d\]: and nowadays,the new pros are often frighteningly strong
rsun [-\]: pincer like pork mincer
TheBear [9k\]: This is going to be interesting 
matroid: black takes 3 corners
storn [2k\]: Geomav, 8d at least
rsun [-\]: territory vs moyo
Long [?\]: lee is using the same amashi strategy
robsclone: hmm what do we think b's plan is for the center? AG was very center-minded in the first few games
geomav [7k\]: ok thanks...
TheBear [9k\]: If he gets the last one who resigns?
go7734 [4d\]: alpha go never had a chance to play c12 @ redmond xD
longbaby [18k?\]: e15!
matroid: lesson learned from last game: AlphaGo goes crazy when it is behind
go7734 [4d\]: this is alpha's first chance against lee sedol where lee played the slide
Long [?\]: erasing alphago is easier than outfight her
Winrry [9k?\]: c13?
Julian1d: AlphaGo has read the pincer deeply and deems it weak. ;)
Winrry [9k?\]: korean innovation
oonicks: i think e14 off
matroid: perhaps Lee wants to extend an early lead to force an error
royu [4d\]: ke jie saying the typical line here of c17 c15 b15 d14 d13 seems good for B because the ladder favors B
Blitzbold [2d?\]: erasing mc-bots much easier than overpower them
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Julian1d - Maybe or maybe not
go7734 [4d\]: w will not mind playing the line with extension instead of ladder
Julian1d: I like this move.
longbaby [18k?\]: place (3,3)
leachy [2k\]: maybe the b c17 d14 variation will be played
go7734 [4d\]: sometimes pro played extension even when ladder was fine
kjgfr: f18
Iniesta [2k\]: b win 20k per loss
cekalo [1k\]: alpha should give Lee handi
dehuong [1k\]: o3 and c14 ladder for B
Deterra [11k?\]: w C12 was nicely situated across from the strength on the right side of the board.
Blitzbold [2d?\]: btw: hi badduck
aham [7k\]: c16
dehuong [1k\]: W c11 is ok but it is not perfect 
Iniesta [2k\]: p15 looks slow
Badduck [2d?\]: hi blitzbold
Julian1d: I think if Lee practiced playing against this version of AlphaGo, Lee would start winning a lot. On the other hand, the same could be said of AlphaGo. ;)
aham [7k\]: C6
robsclone: where's ke jie broadcasting? don't see it on the channel yet
voevius [5k\]: LSD in some kind of trance :-)
royu [4d\]: ke jie predicts c17... thinks d12 doesn't lead to a good position for B
sarahlee [1d?\]: agree julian1dan

go7734 [4d\]: lee deviated from expected 
robsclone: there it is - thank you!
bruh [4d\]: d12 is joseki
Pou7 [2d\]: thx for the link, gogonuts
kjgfr: lee is kyu
Miracle8k [2k?\]: its joseki
TheBear [9k\]: Yup absolutely natural for Lee sedol
Blitzbold [2d?\]: c17 kind of normal, but maybe b doesnt like w getting thick in center?
kjgfr: attach on top
bruh [4d\]: d12 d11 d13 -> C17 and C11 are miai
geomav [7k\]: It would be really interesting if we find out humans can play go "perfectly" and always have a shot at the bots...
go7734 [4d\]: normally we expect c17 c15 b15 d14 d13 c13 b14 e14, but b didn't like it
Julian1d: This looks like a sort of fight that might help W.
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Lee is trying to take advantage of AlphaGo's time management? AlphaGo won't think more deeply on moves that it should think more deeply on.
Deterra [11k?\]: w C13 next?

twoody [3k\]:  D12 clarification
TheBear [9k\]: Hmm I dont want to but I slightly favor whites position right now 
royu [4d\]: oh, alpha did something different
Blitzbold [2d?\]: idk... d12 might lead into these very "vague" fighting where its difficult to tell where the focus lies... thats mc-bots strngth...

Capa21 [11k\]: Does anyone know if AlphaGo considers sente? 
Azal [2d\]: cs update ?
go7734 [4d\]: d10 is likely
MrChips [1k\]: it must
TheBear [9k\]: It should
Syptryn [2d\]: I likle black
Deterra [11k?\]: it must
BongoBob [-\]: seems to consider sente fairly well.
GoIngo [?\]: cs believes 42 % for black here
Azal [2d\]: =)
Azal [2d\]: =(
MrChips [1k\]: can't be a decent player without considering that
Buddy514 [5k?\]: they said that it considers sente iirc
highhand [5k\]: why computer so slow, after b b11 should play next move without thinking
Julian1d: AlphaGo doesn't "know" anything of sente but the algorithm will naturally prefer sente moves where appropriate.
]
;W[dj]C[mtarn567 [6k\]: b will still need to b12 so w can tennuki elsewhere
geomav [7k\]: cs is saying black is losing?
Buddy514 [5k?\]: that was one of the problems in earlier versions against Fan Hui.
highhand [5k\]: wasted time on things it should not have?
Prestige [1d?\]: Lee Sedol please win
sarahlee [1d?\]: it is extrenly freaky when i think this alphgo is actually 1202 cpu connected system and lee is playing with this, kinda scarly movie seen
Jsnake [?\]: Could sente just be a by product of following the win percentages? Meaning it wasn't inherently programmed in?
Julian1d: Right.
go7734 [4d\]: we can use tewari to show that this is pretty decent for w
aham [7k\]: c6
geomav [7k\]: jsake i think so
oonicks: it unsented
voevius [5k\]: it must be
GoIngo [?\]: cs does not say "losing" it only says that it personally thinks that white is up
bruh [4d\]: ResidentSleeper opening
Long [?\]: it is actually 1920 cpu
TheBear [9k\]: AlphaGo is 1902 cpus currently 
njs [1d\]: b12
LinuxGooo [7k\]: g'd morning Europe :-) 
MrChips [1k\]: i think it has very few strict rules regarding the actual techniques of the game programmed in
twoody [3k\]: Someone tell Redmond about c3
MrChips [1k\]: kind of like us humans :)
go7734 [4d\]: after normal c17 instead of c12 joseki w played d11 d12 c12 d13 c10 b11 d10 and it looks like w got an advantage to me
highhand [5k\]: when b has sente maybe should go for g5 (if that area like it is now, so there is no centre moyo

gogonuts [4d\]: lol, rsun
aham [7k\]: c6

go7734 [4d\]: general rule never push first unless you want to cut right away

lofuchi [3k\]: but w has quite a few dead stones
rsun [-\]: for every 2nd line stone the winrate drops by 1%
royu [4d\]: they're saying n8 order is a bit weird right now... and seems like playing l4 or o17 area first makes more sense
Julian1d: Interesting, re: 2nd line stones. :)
Prestige [1d?\]: m7
darkronin [2d?\]: feel the power of the bot :(
royu [4d\]: so there's playing some sequences where w turns at m7 
Trevoke [?\]: Hane

Ray [9k?\]: you know lee makes $500,000 every second 
DemonStyle [3d?\]: M6 seems a little passive. Maybe cut

lofuchi [3k\]: cut looks dangerous :P
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: so first where did he pull the hat out of
lofuchi [3k\]: i would play M6 and that's why i am 3k
DemonStyle [3d?\]: Different strategy. I can't say which is better
weaknoob: those three stone tossed to get two extra stones on top looks much better than before they went to the left side

sarahlee [1d?\]: ray, don't be stupid
Sweetrip [9d\]: black is in trouble

IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: at a glance
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: local fights
KoyoToya [-\]: Perhaps alpha go couldn't accept, with its pure logic algorithms, since it has always won, the fact that it lost
Tictactoe [-\]: for any pro, sequences are priorly known, seen many times before
KoyoToya [-\]: A computer
XiJinping2 [2k\]: cekalo - Same way you know an atari'ed stone on the second line is instantly dead. He has crazy ridiculous instant pattern recognition of many many many shapes

XiJinping2 [2k\]: "So basically, this is not working for white." Redmond, about the current board position
highhand [5k\]: this local fight both players should play quickly, no? nothing else to think about
voevius [5k\]: mis reading early in the game..
kaliya [-\]: Is W insisting like a 20k?
longbaby [18k?\]: an American learning go so early?
Tictactoe [-\]: that's why pro have done their 16h daily training

lofuchi [3k\]: so...
highhand [5k\]: where is korean stream showing Lee expression?
Anatoly [2d?\]: Redmond says that AlphaGo misread this 
XiJinping2 [2k\]: highhang - 99% of the time, AlphaGo takes approximately 1 minute to play a turn
Hanne [?\]: must be boring for redmond being asked to explain snapback again
eatramen [?\]: When AlphaGo plays like this, it thinks it's behind

Acerolion [9k?\]: off

royu [4d\]: they used term 'song si' which means, sent to death. ie. gift of stnoes :(
royu [4d\]: :)

XiJinping2 [2k\]: Redmond is explaining important stuff now
XiJinping2 [2k\]: FOr SDK
gogonuts [4d\]: downright masochistic :-)
XiJinping2 [2k\]: SDK listen up
BongoBob [-\]: SE saying it doesn't know why w R6 group didn't work
Medieval [2d\]: SE loves moyo, so if it thinks B is ahead already.....
K5 [4k?\]: F15?
sprouts [1d\]: G16
MrChips [1k\]: I don't even know where I would begin invading that moyo
Xavo [?\]: Who's strongest go player in the world today?
leachy [2k\]: so maybe g15 instead
Kaidjin [?\]: Guess the next move ! http://gomoveguesser.ab0.fr
kadoban [?\]: myungwan doesn't seem to like this for black
Canarmane [-\]: Invade at tengen :)
KoyoToya [-\]: Xavo: ke jie
indogo [5k?\]: kijie
jellyroll [4k?\]: h13
oonicks: alphaboy added a dead stone one move to l8
aham [7k\]: k13
gogonuts [4d\]: wow, despite bottom right myungwan thinks this is too good for w ...
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Kaidjin - Thanks!!!! http://gomoveguesser.ab0.fr
stokastick [8k?\]: a few days ago, alphago was strongest players. But he got high on drugs since
Canarmane [-\]: bottom right is still susceptible to reduction, no?
Acerolion [9k?\]: It's true, there's crazy moyo for white at top and right
MrChips [1k\]: g15 looks pretty good
js13 [1k\]: still to early for bot to conquer pro go world
mement: is this ayabot?
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone still at 31 % for black here
Azal [2d\]: k12
Badduck [2d?\]: sure its too good for w despite lr?
Julian1d: This seems like one of those places LSD may use a lot of time.
gogonuts [4d\]: g16 most likely
leachy [2k\]: canarmane...reduction only in k3 area
Blitzbold [2d?\]: g15 looks good? fpr b?
bababobo [1d?\]: g16 could work for b
lofuchi [3k\]: b is still behind, i feel like
royu [4d\]: crap, ke jie counts the board so fast
go7734 [4d\]: the bottom right is still less than 50 points, white has so many points on the rest of the board
]
;B[gd]C[Julian1d: Haha.
Blitzbold [2d?\]: g16
gogonuts [4d\]: that's what he's saying
TheBear [9k\]: If game 1 was DeepMind landing on the moon would game 4 be the equivilant of forgetting how to re-enter earths orbit?
Jsnake [?\]: J15?
Long [?\]: wow lee sedol playued my move
jellyroll [4k?\]: love g16
bbred [3k\]: g16: I can count move
Canarmane [-\]: Lee looks a lot happier this game
lofuchi [3k\]: can w F16
Azal [2d\]: what thinks ke jie of this position ?
oonicks: and fortunately because it is a bot it thinks it played ok and does not resign yet:)
Xavo [?\]: great move!!
leachy [2k\]: f15 now could be interesting
bbred [3k\]: yea, not AG thats been taking the chemicals
aham [7k\]: g17
Xavo [?\]: Go Sedol !
Julian1d: I think AlphaGo will find a good response to this.
dehuong [1k\]: @long: it my move too
darkronin [2d?\]: I'm really liking redmond's commentary today
jellyroll [4k?\]: g17 too submissive... that is what b wants...
Julian1d: Me too!
Canarmane [-\]: Redmond sounds more relaxed
Vehix [10k\]: this move was predicted by redmond, who said honinbo Shuwa would have played it
darkronin [2d?\]: might continue watching this rather than the AGA
highhand [5k\]: g16 1 diagonal away from my f15
Badduck [2d?\]: haha sthg like j16
TheBear [9k\]: They should totally give AlphaGo an option to make lude comments when it resigns 
MrChips [1k\]: B looks good
]
;W[gf]C[Canarmane [-\]: right area wrong move separates good from great
Azal [2d\]: uff....
BongoBob [-\]: oh.
gogonuts [4d\]: war
rsun [-\]: let the party begin
jellyroll [4k?\]: e15?
BongoBob [-\]: I knew w would fight.. butg14?
bbred [3k\]: if Mr Lee wins this game, will they make it 6 games?
highhand [5k\]: now b g12
Yubi [?\]: Redmond got used to all-audience commentary, and questions are geared less for non go players
Anatoly [2d?\]: fun fun fun
janwil [4k\]: bbred: no
Blitzbold [2d?\]: mc-bots unbelievable good to find vital point in positions like that
mement: no,, this is final game
bbred [3k\]: arg
Palpatine [1k\]: need god move soon
drueknmstr [3d\]: yeah
stokastick [8k?\]: Bad day for google public communication
danielhast [3k\]: such a clear-cut territory vs. influence game - B has ~60 pts and W has almost no solid territory
Kountch [1k\]: KGS style
mement: and beta go will come soon
wossname [?\]: w+0.5
looneyGO [4k\]: Sorry, what color Lee play? 
Canarmane [-\]: Black
Badduck [2d?\]: hmm g14 feels good
Blitzbold [2d?\]: lee is b
Bisqwit [-\]: Lee is black
looneyGO [4k\]: Thanks! 
cekalo [1k\]: will alphago become a pro after these games
stokastick [8k?\]: lee is black. As per indication in this game you are watching on kgs right now ...
Julian1d: Yes.
bababobo [1d?\]: w defend against n9 cut
Wizardry [4d\]: b+ 1 million
sprouts [1d\]: G17
Canarmane [-\]: I thought they already awarded AG 9d today?
leachy [2k\]: stokastick, the android app doesn't show that
robsclone: G17? i like it, but...wow. 
Blitzbold [2d?\]: @stokastick: some doesnt see the players names when using android
kadoban [?\]: I would imagine at least one go association will give alphago an honorary pro rating?
stokastick [8k?\]: leachy : ho ... okay.
robsclone: you know i don't see it in the KGS java applet, either
sarahlee [1d?\]: hurrah for lee
dehuong [1k\]: g14 amazing
Badduck [2d?\]: game 4 ag was 1p on wbaduk game 5 9p -quite fast?
gogonuts [4d\]: myungwan says b should bet the house on g17
Yubi [?\]: I can see AG as 8p or 7p
highhand [5k\]: I move around w g14 by b g12
EOC: KGA has 9d certificate prepared to present to AlphaGo - on their twitter feed
Bisqwit [-\]: The thing is AlphaGo's rating is entirely dependent on how many CPUs/GPUs are allocated to it, and it's a fluid concept. Money also affects.
EOC: 9p
highhand [5k\]: at least no big moyo
sarahlee [1d?\]: hi, highland
stokastick [8k?\]: Alphago need to go through a basic tesuji book.
Bisqwit [-\]: There's a certain number allocated for it right now for this challenge match, but after the match things are in motion again
aham [7k\]: f15
lofuchi [3k\]: KGA can't give p?
lofuchi [3k\]: just d?
bababobo [1d?\]: Lee will take > 10 minutes here I bet
kadoban [?\]: Bisqwit: Pro ranks aren't based on strength only remember. If you become 9p and then retire and never play again, you could suck at go relatively and you'll still be 9p
ArcticDawn [6k\]: white is already dead at near bottom right, correct?
Ray [9k?\]: does alpha go think during lee sedols move? it makes sense that it wouldnt. 
Yubi [?\]: Well P is a western concept 
highhand [5k\]: cannot have non game related comments or risk ban without warning :(
Long [?\]: actually g16 was too deep, should have been at say g14
Canarmane [-\]: I think W is dead in bottom right 
Bisqwit [-\]: kadoban: Your identity will still be the same. With computer programs the question of identity is murky.
ArcticDawn [6k\]: thanks canarmane
oonicks: i think h14 is pi
Canarmane [-\]: Well tbf they talk about it being dead but I can't read it all out yet
drueknmstr [3d\]: w definitely dead there
aham [7k\]: c16
Bisqwit [-\]: kadoban: Because the hardware installed is part of the program, from an external point of view
Fubini [1k\]: g17 
Buddy514 [5k?\]: white is dead bottom right, but has forcing moves to create thickness Q9R9,etc
mtarn567 [6k\]: then there are titles that you can have even if beaten,  like eternal honinbo or kisei
aham [7k\]: c6
geomav [7k\]: lee's getting up
highhand [5k\]: slide around g14 w g12 pls
Dream [4d\]: g17 is probably right
shahzaib48 [12k\]: wait
santiago [2d\]: listening to redmong, i get the idea that alphago doesn't really know how to play, but it's really good at faking it
santiago [2d\]: redmond
shahzaib48 [12k\]: Did Lee Sedol just lose?
js13 [1k\]: g15
archron0 [4k\]: g17 was played
highhand [5k\]: use g16 for fighting later
geomav [7k\]: no he takes a break about this time
go7734 [4d\]: alphago can fake better than lee sedol then
indogo [5k?\]: curious about alphago continuation, what AG will do after this
santiago [2d\]: yes, i know'
Canarmane [-\]: g17? 
shahzaib48 [12k\]: Or is the game still continuing
]
;B[gc]
;W[fd]C[bbred [3k\]: cut if off and kill it!!!
Xavo [?\]: Who is Alphagirl?
TheBear [9k\]: w
AlphaG00 [2k\]: ...
highhand [5k\]: still play g12
basildon [3d\]: time to alive.
Bisqwit [-\]: I am kind of afraid that as soon as this challenge is over, the money will be directed to other things, as tends to happen with research projects driven by PR
KoyoToya [-\]: Better question
jellyroll [4k?\]: k17 seems important
shahzaib48 [12k\]: Someone please answer did Lee Sedol just lose or is the game still continuing
lofuchi [3k\]: wow
Falcon89 [5k\]: indogo, Alpha will take a vacation in Cape Cod
KoyoToya [-\]: Who's alpha stop?
lofuchi [3k\]: b is brave
Canarmane [-\]: ??
Canarmane [-\]: Why would you think Lee just lost?
BongoBob [-\]: game is still going, shahzaib
Bisqwit [-\]: Game is still going on of course.
Badduck [2d?\]: not much difference now to b startin with g17 instead g16?
Ray [9k?\]: lee lost the match not the game
Acerolion [9k?\]: Did alphago just let sedol live
BongoBob [-\]: lee taking a breather
bbred [3k\]: game is continueing
geomav [7k\]: cause he got up
shahzaib48 [12k\]: Oh
lofuchi [3k\]: get a base at k17?
santiago [2d\]: lee is a little bit ahead in this game
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Acerolion - It's being handled by AlphaGo subroutines now
ArcticDawn [6k\]: wait i think bottom right it is who plays first who captures
BongoBob [-\]: humans have to step away sometimes
Anatoly [2d?\]: Kim: "professionals analyzed AlphaGo's games and found that AlphaGo is weak at attacking"
drueknmstr [3d\]: w is like 'here have some territory'
ArcticDawn [6k\]: ?
basildon [3d\]: off well - time to surive...
basildon [3d\]: ohh*
lofuchi [3k\]: or G15 first...it looks stupid though
oonicks: alphago conencted, maybe it knows sequences for g14
highhand [5k\]: what are pros saying at this point of time?
bbred [3k\]: k17 or k16?
ToastyKen: So Lee is winning now because AlphaGo misplayed at bottom right and lost its group?
sarahlee [1d?\]: 12k sshld know whether the game end or not
matroid: pro's must be all smiling now
BrentoBox [4k\]: Oh talking trash now huh
XiJinping2 [2k\]: highhand - Redmond is speculating on why AlphaGo isn't playing so well this game
Ray [9k?\]: Alpha go doesnt think during lees turn it already goes through the variations and needs the next input to continue its policy network calc
BrentoBox [4k\]: Lee Sedols blind grandmother could see that move
gogonuts [4d\]: w still good after lr, surprisingly
zyklop [1k\]: b f15?
basildon [3d\]: depends if B will survive... 
highhand [5k\]: thx XiJinping2, other pro opinion?
gogonuts [4d\]: but myungwan called g14 a mistake
Bisqwit [-\]: Ray: It does think during the opponent's turn though.
Azal [2d\]: what does ke jie says ?
basildon [3d\]: will be huge win for white if b fails here.
Acerolion [9k?\]: Maybe this time AG will play a god move?
GoIngo [?\]: cs evaluation still at 32 % for black here
Xavo [?\]: I looked forward to this. This is sedol's style, Yoo Changhuk says
jellyroll [4k?\]: if b is forced to live top side, w center gets kinda big...
Badduck [2d?\]: g14 mistake?
Blitzbold [2d?\]: well lr wasnt so costly... and ii was definitely an area in which b could easily make blunders - at least in the monte carlo tree
shahzaib48 [12k\]: If lee Sedol would've won 3 games he would've won 1 million dollars?
danielhast [3k\]: Ke Jie says J16
GoIngo [?\]: perhaps alphago was already in rolling home mode when playing lower right
bbred [3k\]: no, g14 is hane at head of 3 stones
Julian1d: G14 doesn't seem like a clear mistake to me yet.
highhand [5k\]: ke jie has video link?
Julian1d: (I like it.)
danielhast [3k\]: (according to someone in AGA stream translating some of his remarks)
Canarmane [-\]: why only a one space jump with j16?
Long [?\]: lee can definitely shinogi out of this
Bisqwit [-\]: Heh, I'm reminded of that Hikaru no Go episode where the opponent went driving a motorcycle in the middle of a match to calm down.
ArcticDawn [6k\]: white lost big on right side there
BongoBob [-\]: That would be me in a big tournament.
Long [?\]: after that , simple position to play since black is solid everywehre
robsclone: lol Bisqwit
ArcticDawn [6k\]: It is trying to create centre territory
ruby [2d\]: f18 
Falcon89 [5k\]: why J16, k16 not possible ?
Canarmane [-\]: Ke Jie knows best but I don't understand at all :(
matroid: Lee has left his seat
NoSeki [5k?\]: Who is B?
Bisqwit [-\]: Lee is back I think, I saw a shadow
Canarmane [-\]: B is some amateur
matroid: celebrating already...
Bisqwit [-\]: And he played a move.
danielhast [3k\]: Lee is B, AG is W
Xavo [?\]: Alphago cannot beat me, Ke Jie says.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAAY532UQZA&t=2540s
Falcon89 [5k\]: Sedol is B

;B[ge]C[NoSeki [5k?\]: Thx
BongoBob [-\]: push up first.
robsclone: Bisqwit:   http://puu.sh/nFFHN/3968462490.jpg  hehehe
geomav [7k\]: 6 more weeks of winter
dehuong [1k\]: why don't B play f16 instead g17 
Blitzbold [2d?\]: if u are so kind GoIngo... :)
Canarmane [-\]: Is it better to push with G15 than to play F14 first?
Azal [2d\]: ups no one saw f14
sarahlee [1d?\]: Kejie? i wanna see Guli comments
mtarn567 [6k\]: if seedol needs to,  he will need to make it so there is a I to reduce that centre with I think
RedPTown [6k\]: That makes sense even to me
js13 [1k\]: g14 move, bot underestimated pro. lee will make territory inside white area
GoIngo [?\]: cs eval still 31-32 % for black
Tictactoe [-\]: living in punxatawny geomav?
Bisqwit [-\]: robsclone: People are making these analogies a lot :)
mtarn567 [6k\]: aji 
nu [2k\]: lsd going to give up b16 stone for power in middle maybe
Kountch [1k\]: What a quick play

robsclone: they*
gogonuts [4d\]: nasty f14
Canarmane [-\]: oh baby
Canarmane [-\]: things are getting spicey
go7734 [4d\]: f14 is nice move
robsclone: i like it
Julian1d: This is the sort of fight both players like. ;)
Kountch [1k\]: How is it nasty?
Canarmane [-\]: F14 feels slack, should W have done more to corral B towards left?
go7734 [4d\]: f14 leaves cut for w but attacks fiercer

;W[hg]
;B[if]C[Xavo [?\]: Lee is leading!!
Badduck [2d?\]: not much room for a big w cemter
cekalo [1k\]: alpha will kill this!
Kountch [1k\]: He is Leeding
Azal [2d\]: i trust cs
go7734 [4d\]: but since the corner mostly alive cut is not so bad
js13 [1k\]: of course he is
dehuong [1k\]: what is CS?
sarahlee [1d?\]: Lee is leeding
Kountch [1k\]: Coputer Science?
gogonuts [4d\]: f14 is aggressive, not slack
Bisqwit [-\]: Michael thinks AlphaGo is behind, but not so far behind yet that it would start playing insane moves that don't work like in match four.
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: crazystein
igoAggie [2k\]: CrazyStone, a go program
Doli [7k\]: Counter Strike
Canarmane [-\]: LS controlling the tempo this game, much better for him
hkterry [3d\]: counter strike

dehuong [1k\]: i haven't heard it 
igoAggie [2k\]: It's pretty strong

;W[ig]C[Julian1d: I wouldn't expect W to kill this.
igoAggie [2k\]: kgs 5d or something probably
geomav [7k\]: apparently it has win % prediction
shinigami [2d?\]: lol
Blitzbold [2d?\]: cant be counter-strike, as not enough strafe jumping here
Canarmane [-\]: W is gonna start to make  moyo shape if he keeps pushing B, he could profit large off this
robsclone: j13 not bad
igoAggie [2k\]: You can buy it for $80
Long [?\]: white is going all in, usually people would just attack to gain profit
Canarmane [-\]: doesn't even have to kill
dehuong [1k\]: the center is so big
shinigami [2d?\]: W is definitely 9d
Kountch [1k\]: He is not 9P, he has no professional diploma.
igoAggie [2k\]: W is obviously 9p. 
mfg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60VABUREwOY crazystone stream here
rsun [-\]: alpha replaces L6 with a w stone
Julian1d: Yep. Except it doesn't know some tesuji. ;)
asdfa: alphago won 77% of games against crazystone when giving 4 handi
Azal [2d\]: AG looking to something at j7
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol looks happy with his position
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Lee Hajin is on the Redmond stream now https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzpW10DPHeQ
Ahamay [7d?\]: On reddit there's a rumor that it might be awarded a 9p certifitace after this match
kadoban [?\]: Position looking a bit harder for white
BongoBob [-\]: ohh haijin!
Canarmane [-\]: LS is looking relatively relaxed
js13 [1k\]: go lee, make bot show its "crazy move" again
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: k16?
sarahlee [1d?\]: i heard that with 1 million prize money, alphago marries other beautiful female computer and retire in one of carribian islands
Bisqwit [-\]: mfg: What's this?
Trevoke [?\]: ~49k people watching
BigDoug [-\]: please stop the random comments
TheBear [9k\]: I have no clue who Hajin Lee is I learned Go cause hikaru no go 
sarahlee [1d?\]: sorry big
BigDoug [-\]: thank you
igoAggie [2k\]: Hajin is a go player who streams her games sometimes
igoAggie [2k\]: she is a korean pro
sarahlee [1d?\]: welcome
geomav [7k\]: she is actually a huge coordinator in the match
c137 [2k\]: probably significantlly more than that with korean, japan, chinese coverage
Canarmane [-\]: Following Redmond's question, would you rather play J16 or keep pushing as B?
TheBear [9k\]: Oh cool 
Wizardry [4d\]: must k14?
igoAggie [2k\]: My instinct would be to keep pushing
shinigami [2d?\]: lee hajin saw lee sedol's move 78 yesterday before lee did
geomav [7k\]: she is 3p pro
Julian1d: B taking some time on this one.
robsclone: i like his call of j16...but not, here. 
kadoban [?\]: J16 seems ... not right to me. Either something bigger or keep extending I think.
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Lee Hajin is pro at hiding her face from the stream
Burton [6k\]: how much time do the players have left
aham [7k\]: pushing
]
;B[id]C[jellyroll [4k?\]: yay vital points!
BongoBob [-\]: alphago, 1:18  Lee 0:56

Canarmane [-\]: ohh, builds an eye first
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: why j16 and not k16
kadoban [?\]: Well, I fail at guess the move.
BongoBob [-\]: in h:mm
Ephidel [1k\]: j16 is the shape point
wossname [?\]: k16 flawed
cekalo [1k\]: J18
Dream [4d\]: j16 looks good
Canarmane [-\]: j16 is guaranteed eye
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: k16 gets a bit more space?
shinigami [2d?\]: j16 means B is practically alive
Dream [4d\]: w cant make the moyo big enough to win
kadoban [?\]: I probably would have done K17
goren22 [2k\]: k14
Poney [2d\]: check SE haha
superpal1 [1d\]: \\o/ lee sedol \\o/
aham [7k\]: k14
Canarmane [-\]: k17 super greedy, I think AG would punish
rsun [-\]: Nie Weiping says alphago is 13-15d in middle game
robsclone: yeah, that's a good move like he said.  I like that he's confident and yet still playing safely
Acerolion [9k?\]: why J16 over K16?
Buddy514 [5k?\]: Hajin has to push her book more.  When she introduces herself, she should alwasy mention that she has a book she's working on.
sarahlee [1d?\]: i love lee se dol
mysticgirl [14k?\]: Who is b
Crono9987 [3d\]: even though it looks close, the tempo of this game feels happy for sedol this time
]
;W[jf]C[IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: apparently because j16 is more betterer
robsclone: lee = b
njs [1d\]: k15
jellyroll [4k?\]: here comes that moyo
Slain [3k\]: J16 better shape than K16, b is ahead
LordVader [1d\]: SE having a hard time :)
shinigami [2d?\]: double hane coming
goren22 [2k\]: watch b k13...
aham [7k\]: k15
Azal [2d\]: j16 seems odd
Julian1d: I would say this game has felt good for B from the start.
Azal [2d\]: o maybe cut ?
jellyroll [4k?\]: would LOVE k13
asdfa: seems real nice for W, no?
robsclone: j16 makes a very safe group for b in that area
weirdchess [-\]: crazystone win percentage?
Crono9987 [3d\]: i wonder why bots seem to all favor the middle so much
Badduck [2d?\]:  w play not that impressive?
Canarmane [-\]: cut now or connect?
Crono9987 [3d\]: seems like all of the bots are written by takemiya
shahzaib48 [12k\]: CUT
shinigami [2d?\]: bot didn't necessarily favor middle
Slug [1k\]: W might get a big middle from this
aham [7k\]: l16
go7734 [4d\]: b cannot cut
santiago [2d\]: cut? are you crazy?
Ray [9k?\]: lee forced him to have the middle
ruby [2d\]: cut too dangerous
geomav [7k\]: 32%  if im reading it right
shinigami [2d?\]: sedol just took territory in the beginning all the time
NoSeki [5k?\]: This looks so good for w
Ephidel [1k\]: just k15 yeah?
shinigami [2d?\]: so sedol forced the tempo
Xavo [?\]: Baduk means Bad UK
go7734 [4d\]: k15 is forced
robsclone: the first few games, the middle was the large deciding factor for AG's win, wasn't it?
go7734 [4d\]: or another similar move
shahzaib48 [12k\]: The group from N18 to N8 to damn big
Julian1d: I suspect B already read much of this move.
geomav [7k\]: BUT CS is like 5 moves behind
Ephidel [1k\]: well, black has l6 and d12
shahzaib48 [12k\]: need to reove some of that
goren22 [2k\]: I see b m15 actually
jellyroll [4k?\]: w center can still be reduced from right side and bottom center.... 
Ephidel [1k\]: so the center isn't so big
geomav [7k\]: CS has to calculate I imaggine
Canarmane [-\]: getting ahead of the push is big for W now tho
weirdchess [-\]: geomav, that's white win percent = 32?
mtarn567 [6k\]: depends on  how thick w makes it. 
stokastick [8k?\]: if somehow black loose, he will be very ashamed ... although alphago did loose anyway in this game
GoIngo [?\]: cs now at 33 % for black
robsclone: m15? not seeing it
Julian1d: Whoa.
rsun [-\]: w is way too thick, like an impregnable brick

;B[jb]C[geomav [7k\]: According to earlier posters...no... thats b... bis behind in CS
goren22 [2k\]: um...
Trevoke [?\]: w....?
robsclone: hmmmm
Canarmane [-\]: Lee is going to have to make a very brave invade in the center
XiJinping2 [2k\]: K18 seems very limited and small at this point
lofuchi [3k\]: this is surprising
Badduck [2d?\]: k18?
Azal [2d\]: o.O??? too much coffee
shahzaib48 [12k\]: Who is currently in the leadÉ
Ephidel [1k\]: oh i guess b just wants to live
lofuchi [3k\]: so conservative
Canarmane [-\]: whaaaa
oldguy [4d\]: Did bigdoug ban bot est this game?
stokastick [8k?\]: badduck : ko threat ...
ruby [2d\]: lee is drunk
go7734 [4d\]: is lee bugged?
leachy [2k\]: well....noone predicted that one
rsun [-\]: this shape is similar to game 1
robsclone: lol g7734
goren22 [2k\]: setting up m15 then cutting at k13
shahzaib48 [12k\]: I would reccommend waiting before you say tis a bad move.
IlanKeshet [-\]: w so busted
TheBear [9k\]: Bottom left corner is still very invadable 
BongoBob [-\]: what is k18?
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: nice 2nd line play
Slain [3k\]: Yeah, w has to protext that cut now
robsclone: huh...
pipu [5d\]: i could never think of this...
geomav [7k\]: CS is about 7 moves behind though
lofuchi [3k\]: perhaps Lee saw some powerful attack
leachy [2k\]: i suspect so goren
androlive [5k\]: Whar about time remaining?
Wizardry [4d\]: white has two cutting points now
Poney [2d\]: If k15  w would've K17 I guess
Badduck [2d?\]: ok K.O. threat...
shinigami [2d?\]: bigdoug only doesn't like too much bot win percentage talk, if we keep it managable we are good
jellyroll [4k?\]: b may look to make live, and then e14 cut
robsclone: okay, yeah. that sets up the strength for moving more towards M
Canarmane [-\]: right but if LS invades the bottom left with the aim of taking the corner, it is going to give W thickness and solidify his center
leachy [2k\]: must be linked to that k13 cut 
oldguy [4d\]: yes, i also loved the bot est
GoIngo [?\]: cs does not understand k18
XiJinping2 [2k\]: White played wK16 in game already
Ephidel [1k\]: hmm
]
;W[jd]C[rsun [-\]: count #1st/2nd line stones: Lee 10, Alpha 5
lofuchi [3k\]: this doesn't seem very sucessful for b
IlanKeshet [-\]: this is fine for black
Wizardry [4d\]: must wedge?
rsun [-\]: Lee 11
jellyroll [4k?\]: so agressive.
IlanKeshet [-\]: black is so far ahead
leachy [2k\]: well....now comes teh cutting
bbred [3k\]: must cuy?
Badduck [2d?\]: not sure if led would play k18 against human
bbred [3k\]: cut
lofuchi [3k\]: or maybe this is what b can do, can't ask for more
shahzaib48 [12k\]: K15!
robsclone: could be quite smart set of moves for b.  get w to concentrate on that group's life, and then take advantage of the thickness
Canarmane [-\]: k15 for B would be bad I think
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Black played bK17 in game
]
;B[jc]C[Johnma [1k?\]: k18 looks to settle b in sente?
jellyroll [4k?\]: w so good at making huge moyos
leachy [2k\]: i guess so johnma
c137 [2k\]: this is good enough for B
cohen [4k?\]: W loks too big
rsun [-\]: alpha tenuki again
goren22 [2k\]: simply l16 now?
Kountch [1k\]: How can B reduce such a moyo?
lofuchi [3k\]: b gets sente
rsun [-\]: like K7
Azal [2d\]: c137 b behind by a lot
leachy [2k\]: just hoping there was some cut tactics
DrSFBrains [1k\]: SE has an amusing view...
Acerolion [9k?\]: That exchange doesn't look like it's good for sedol
shahzaib48 [12k\]: Dive in there like a Boss just go super saiyan and play O12
XiJinping2 [2k\]: It looks tiny for black
rsun [-\]: alpha going to K7 or J7
lofuchi [3k\]: maybe SE is right
shahzaib48 [12k\]: To reduce the moyo
Xavo [?\]: This is Human style, right?
Pauline: what is the link for Kejie stream ?
IlanKeshet [-\]: w's ONLY potential is in the top middle...
XiJinping2 [2k\]: It's still time for black and white to be playing big moves
cekalo [1k\]: how much money does a pro make?
alhwong [?\]: black already has big lower right
hio: moyo still not big enough compare to b huge corner imo
IlanKeshet [-\]: black has much more cash
XiJinping2 [2k\]: But black lives here in a small group, takes some white territory, but helps build huge white moyo zone
Blitzbold [2d?\]: yes - i also thought alpha will k7
Azal [2d\]: center looking huge for w
robsclone: these moves give strength to use for the upper-left corner for b, doesn't it?
]
;W[je]C[hio: w still have weaknesses
alhwong [?\]: k8 big
IlanKeshet [-\]: I expect w to play c5 or c4 next
Badduck [2d?\]: k8 or so?
cohen [4k?\]: Now b is alive
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Robsclone - I think you're right there's a strong connection one of the players is going to have to resolve
IlanKeshet [-\]: or K3
Bisqwit [-\]: I wonder if W can still get mileage out of those dead white stones in lower right
alhwong [?\]: or k7 for white?
go7734 [4d\]: k15 was very big
IlanKeshet [-\]: i dunno
lofuchi [3k\]: can b tenuki
go7734 [4d\]: it has followups
gogonuts [4d\]: myungwan sounding not amused again
lofuchi [3k\]: no probably
go7734 [4d\]: b is alive but w has followups
Ephidel [1k\]: i dunno if b will tenuki
goren22 [2k\]: how's about b9?
leachy [2k\]: aji in the white position but i can't see anything sente there
Long [?\]: actually white dead group is alot of ko threat
aham [7k\]: d18
Xavo [?\]: K 8
agent86kyu [13k\]: is Myungwan really a skinjob?
Long [?\]: outside forcing moves too
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Good point, Long
Pauline: what is the link for ke jie stream ?
Johnma [1k?\]: So tempting to play k8
Bisqwit [-\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzpW10DPHeQ for the English stream
Kountch [1k\]: Maybe time for Tengen
Long [?\]: i think ko is not an option for lee sedol in this game 
LoneStar [3d\]: j15
lofuchi [3k\]: seems necessary
rsun [-\]: w is too thick this game, no place for myoshu like last game
LoneStar [3d\]: how long are you
Long [?\]: white loses a few points for playing that sequence but seal off the side anytime she wishes, and plus ko threat too
XiJinping2 [2k\]: LongStar?
danielhast [3k\]: from AGA stream chat: "Ke Jie: black isn't ahead by much even after live in sente"
Badduck [2d?\]: c3 not small
matroid: why is white in such a hurry to kill black when black can a life easily?
Bisqwit [-\]: Ke Jie stream live: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s

Acerolion [9k?\]: To make its moyo strong

;B[gh]C[go7734 [4d\]: white didn't really lose any points for the bottom right, only lost in making b extra thick
Bisqwit [-\]: No, sorry, that's actually Kimg Myungwan commentating.
go7734 [4d\]: after g12 w could j17
Pauline: yes
jellyroll [4k?\]: g12 so great
LoneStar [3d\]: ke jie speaking english?
Xavo [?\]: Yoo Changhyuklive commentary - http://sports.news.naver.com/tv/index.nhn?category=etc&gameId=20160315BADUK
rsun [-\]: not sure if it's great
go7734 [4d\]: j17 looks good for w to me
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Redmond says b needs one more move to live, but b played bG12 instead, and Redmond says it's a bit of a scary move (but black group not dead yet)
GoIngo [?\]: cs gives 28 % for black here  --- on wrong steamer?
Acerolion [9k?\]: CS may be right, doesn't look good for b
rsun [-\]: 28% looks correct
rsun [-\]: I'm 82% confident
Buddy514 [5k?\]: I heard it takes about $50/hr of electricity to run alphago during this match.
goren22 [2k\]: now we're gonna see the power of the comps when they kill 
Tonight [5k\]: i think that white is better
Long [?\]: same as yesterday until lee pulled a myoshu
BlackSmurf [2k?\]: 72?
leachy [2k\]: 28C=82F
rsun [-\]: no place for myoshu this time
rsun [-\]: w too thick
Acerolion [9k?\]: Doesn't look like there's a myoshu available with this thickness
Bisqwit [-\]: Buddy: Relatively cheap considering other costs of the match, but not something you would have running for leisure
gogonuts [4d\]: i think cs unreliable because of lr uncertainty
Long [?\]: this sort of game is better for lee sedol vs alphago since alphago can outread anybody on this planet in fighting
LoneStar [3d\]: is it alive?
robsclone: f18, like Redmond said
Acerolion [9k?\]: It didn't outread sedol in game 4
GoIngo [?\]: gogonuts: but histograms smooth

LoneStar [3d\]: K8 
Deterra [11k?\]: Redmond seems to be suggesting that W has put all their eggs in the moyo basket.  May explain how AlphaGo still thinks it has a large win %
oonicks: google censoring tool and nyt are friends
Acerolion [9k?\]: explosive move?
Acerolion [9k?\]: C4 is an explosive move

;B[jl]C[dehuong [1k\]: is W leading?
Acerolion [9k?\]: c3 isn't an explosive
hio: no
LoneStar [3d\]: MUhaha
Canarmane [-\]: W needs to make territory desperately
Vehix [10k\]: redmond thinks b ahead
Gotham88 [4k\]: i think 
XiJinping2 [2k\]: K8 looks tiny too but I won't judge a 9p's moves too harshly
LoneStar [3d\]: i am as good s LSD
goren22 [2k\]: k9
dehuong [1k\]: c5 so big
H [-\]: What's the status of q7 and r8 groups?
Acerolion [9k?\]: c3 is propane
Ray [9k?\]: if w is leading im lead
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: c was the first, then c2, then c3, then c4 actually
Bisqwit [-\]: Lee will be very happy, if he wins this match. He will have won both as black and as white. And of course, he will get $20k per win even though he didn't win the tournament.
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Lone Stardol?
go7734 [4d\]: q7 is dead, but w gets q9 r9 s9 in sente
Slain [3k\]: Q7 dead, R8 alive
alobar [9k\]: whie must make territory calmly, not desperately
Slain [3k\]: but some ko threats
Gotham88 [4k\]: lee managed to find out what's Alphago weakness.. I am guessing. alphago is unable to correctly predict the score when certain areas are not clear like R 8
kadoban [?\]: AGA stream break, boo.
H [-\]: Thanks
Plexux9090: becubio
robsclone: that's an interesting thought Gotham88
Canarmane [-\]: AG also seems to have trouble with the center
Azal [2d\]: gotham88 could be true... same maybe for CS
Becubio [4k\]: Plexus?
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Gotham88 - I doubt it, but that's a unique idea I haven't seen yet
Canarmane [-\]: rather, making territory with the center

Azal [2d\]: oh
manta [3d\]: alive
Azal [2d\]: silly moves 
USSRMan [3d\]: i still cant believe how game 4, bot just threw a temper tantum and lost a close game
Long [?\]: alphago weakness is playing a moyo game, which it really likes to play, don't play a fighting game with alphago
hio: bot again forcing moves
robsclone: hmmmm
Ephidel [1k\]: lol
cekalo [1k\]: b is dead

Ephidel [1k\]: first g18
narugo [1d\]: h18 looks bad move
NoSeki [5k?\]: Not dead
Deterra [11k?\]: I don't think AlphaGo acknowledges the "risk factor" in creating moyo territory over edge territory
DemonStyle [3d?\]: There's the threat to connect to O18
Plexux9090: surrender at 20 pls
Tictactoe [-\]: crazy stone lacks to calculate c3
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: now lsd knwos he will win
botBot [?\]: Redmond already commented the whole sequence out
Blitzbold [2d?\]: actually h11 weakened h17 group remarkably
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: ag making weird moves again
Julian1d: This isn't that weird.
botBot [?\]: h18 is not weird move
go7734 [4d\]: this is not the kind of weird move from game 4
bababobo [1d?\]: could w play g18 quickly ?
kadoban [?\]: alphago has always done these kind of moves
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: isnt it pointless tho?
go7734 [4d\]: this is weird move from game 1 and 2 
kadoban [?\]: Even in the winning agmes.
USSRMan [3d\]: game 4's weird move were 30k level
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: h18
XiJinping2 [2k\]: They're weird to a 7k :P

DrSFBrains [1k\]: g18 g19 j18 h19 j19 f19 l19  with l18 and n19 miai
botBot [?\]: its not weird
]
;B[gb]C[IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: ok i accept its not weird, im just too shtoopid to understand :"(
go7734 [4d\]: h18 is likely to be white's best endgame, and certainly h18 is sente
Badduck [2d?\]: possible that ag feels its behind?
robsclone: Lee's sweatin'
Bisqwit [-\]: H18 doesn't look weird to me at all... But then again, Redmond did go through that sequence already and determined B lives
kadoban [?\]: It is weird, it's just expected weird.
go7734 [4d\]: so white can be just playing endgame sente early 
Wizardry [4d\]: normally you'd save such moves as ko threats, but i think alphago just wants to reduce right away
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Look at Lee's hands, always moving
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Redmond says all the pros move/fiddle their hands when they're thinking
GoIngo [?\]: cs expecting g19 and happy
Deterra [11k?\]: It's interesting to see the mood differences between the two gentlemen at the goban.  One is under huge mental strain and the other isn't, and it really shows.
]
;W[ga]C[hkterry [3d\]: If Lee died here, it'd be more serious than his 0-5 defeat to Alpha lol
Bisqwit [-\]: AlphaGo likes to maximize its winning percentage, and somehow retaining ko threats doesn't seem to be part of that goal
narugo [1d\]: yep atleast timing looks early as black dont move there if not
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Deterra - The AlphaGo rep looks very.... aloof :)
Deterra [11k?\]: It's kinda funny hahaha
XiJinping2 [2k\]: He's 6d amateur I think
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: yes whats the benefit of losing allt he ko threast and solidifying black living gtroup at top?
go7734 [4d\]: it's keeping the r9 threats at least xD
goren22 [2k\]: doesn't aja play here?
Deterra [11k?\]: So that's good.  At least he knows what's going on.
Long [?\]: b easily live
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: what did h18 acheve?
Plexux9090: deep mind
jellyroll [4k?\]: alphago plays this too soon..  much like bottom right... rruining aji
danielhast [3k\]: Kim Myungwan's count: B has 66 points, W should get more than 50 points, game might be close
Long [?\]: just forcing move to seal the top
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Thanks, danielhast
USSRMan [3d\]: tbh, if alphago didnt throw temper tantrum in game 4, i think he had a good chance of winning
USSRMan [3d\]: at least 40%
Falcon89 [5k\]: h18 makes j17 a false eye but Sedol already knows 
Bisqwit [-\]: Maybe H18 is for creating sente moves that increase the chances that the W group in upper left will live
]
;B[ib]C[XiJinping2 [2k\]: Falcon - Somebody needs to warn Lee Sedol
go7734 [4d\]: yes with f19 sente it helps the white upper left
Ephidel [1k\]: lolll
Julian1d: Yeah. It's probably too soon but for a bot that's still a minor mistake.
Long [?\]: i think everybody is overestimate alphago strength comparing to top pro, top pro can't fight with alphago, but fundamentally alphago cannot compare
Falcon89 [5k\]: that's your job, Chairman Xi
blau3: Q: remaining time for both?
kadoban [?\]: Long: Keep some perspective though, it's won the match and won 3 games out of 4 so far.
gogonuts [4d\]: looks like J16 wasnt enough
botBot [?\]: Remember, AlphaGo is still a prototype.. not even in Beta
XiJinping2 [2k\]: 1h05m for AlphaGo, and 42m for Lee Sedol
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Remaining
blau3: thx
danielhast [3k\]: Kim says this is a good sequence for W - seals off upper right
USSRMan [3d\]: but game 4 shows it is fundamentally flowed
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol 42m, alph 65m left
Falcon89 [5k\]: thx  TTT

;W[ha]C[alobar [9k\]: i said good sequence four moves ago
XiJinping2 [2k\]: danielhast - Seals off N14 area you mean?
alobar [9k\]:  let me do commentary
Blitzbold [2d?\]: nope ussrman: thats just a thing that happens with mc
blau3: after j19 f19 m18 turns k19 into a B eye, doesn't it?
gogonuts [4d\]: a misread in some deep variation isnt "fundamentally flawed"
gogonuts [4d\]: and alphago is winning again
hkterry [3d\]: Is Alpha aiming at the right-hand corner? 
USSRMan [3d\]: when it is slightly behind, alphago thinks it has completely lost because it plays against it self, so it self distructs
Julian1d: (Redmond is explaining how W profits. ;)
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: blak under pressure on top @_@
Canarmane [-\]: AG still down like 15~ points no?
USSRMan [3d\]: that is a deep flaw
Blitzbold [2d?\]: again nope ussrman
jellyroll [4k?\]: b alive
go7734 [4d\]: alpha is not behind at all
hkterry [3d\]: The sequence just for n19
Bisqwit [-\]: USSRMan, with any computer program there are chances the programmer overlooked some aspect or detail. And in match 4 something was probably found. The programmers will be working on that detail and it will affect AlphaGo's game style in future matches.
botBot [?\]: Remember, AlphaGo is still a prototype.. not even in Beta
XiJinping2 [2k\]: "Lee Sedol is thinking about the exact order he should play his next moves in" Redmond now
kadoban [?\]: Game seems pretty even if anything.
Cyphase [?\]: NotEvenBetaGo

XiJinping2 [2k\]: botBot, I think that's an important poin
XiJinping2 [2k\]: point
Blitzbold [2d?\]: +5 cyphase :)
Dream [4d\]: L19 looks best
robsclone: botBot the idea would be if it can continue to grow on this path, and continue to improve or not
kadoban [?\]: Is ReleaseGo the final version then?
matroid: M18
oonicks: 3go is the final one
GoIngo [?\]: I tried one pass for white and black move on r7; result: still only 36 % for Black
XiJinping2 [2k\]: The super basic, rudimentary nature of AlphaGo's time management drove home to me that AlphaGo is truly a prototype still, and not a finished product really
USSRMan [3d\]: im sure the team at deepmind will fix whatever flaw it had in game 4
Blitzbold [2d?\]: matroid is greedy :)
GoIngo [?\]: in cs opinion
Canarmane [-\]: if they can somehow create a derivative of AG that focuses on teaching players they should name is Sai
esrig [6k\]: I like the AGA channel better than the DeepMind channel
Bisqwit [-\]: The problem in match 4 was fundamentally that the moves that Lee Sedol did were so unlikely that they were off the search radar for AlphaGo, and thus the bot did not predict them. Everything that came after that was just a consequence of the bot knowing it's behind and desperately trying to get back on track.
matroid: greedy is good

;W[fa]C[botBot [?\]: With better supercomputer and better algorithm, AI will keep improving
Plexux9090: zzz xD

;B[ka]C[Xylol [4k?\]: i just joined
Nam [-\]: m18 , m17 . l19
Ray [9k?\]: Canarame comment got a tear in my eye
Xylol [4k?\]: how is it?
Nam [-\]: that lived
robsclone: esrig: i'm switching back and forth, as each catches up their commentary to the moves
jellyroll [4k?\]: love l19
USSRMan [3d\]: it knew it was behind, but it was not unwinnable at that point, but it started throwing away points left and right
Blitzbold [2d?\]: ... but greedy only works on matroids and inersection of 2 matroids :)
USSRMan [3d\]: for humans, it is a close game, but alphago is so strong, it thought it just lost so it started self-distructing
Badduck [2d?\]: it happened in 1 out of 4 games and its not fundamental?
USSRMan [3d\]: that it a flaw in the MC strategy if the bot is too strong
dehuong [1k\]: I hope Lee does not make mistake
Bisqwit [-\]: The bot probably thought that there's a higher chance those stupid moves will result in opponent's blunder (and thus B regaining lead) than any complicated followup would have had.
narugo [1d\]: offcourse AI will keep improving even without algorithm changes, computing power with same money doubles in every two years 
Deterra [11k?\]: Redmond's dissection of this situation just now was great.
danielhast [3k\]: Kim says game is very close
XiJinping2 [2k\]: USSRMan - The self-destructing makes the goban gobang
]
;W[iq]C[robsclone: narugo but, strategy
Azal [2d\]: =O
XiJinping2 [2k\]: J3 seems huge
Reym [-\]: maybe it was the combination ko + ladder that crashed it yesterday
KoyoToya [-\]: Kim has said that every time
Ephidel [1k\]: ?
Falcon89 [5k\]: huge
IlanKeshet [-\]: ??
Bisqwit [-\]: When the game is even, or when the bot is in lead, the bot does not fall into that kind of thinking
Ephidel [1k\]: this looks so small
matroid: white is playing slow moves
IlanKeshet [-\]: wow
shinigami [2d?\]: this isn't small
botBot [?\]: good local move
botBot [?\]: its huge
shinigami [2d?\]: it's preparing for k7 cut/aji
oonicks: somewhere n that area or h8
GoIngo [?\]: slow bot moves normal when it thinks to be ahead
Bisqwit [-\]: When the bot is playing slow moves, it think it's ahead
Vehix [10k\]: redmond says aiming at cutting k8 stone
botBot [?\]: its not slow move
robsclone: Redmond is thinking something along the lines of m10
oonicks: oh and h8 is also wrong
kadoban [?\]: It doesn't look slow to me ...
Blitzbold [2d?\]: that move doesnt feel so slow...
USSRMan [3d\]: but if it is slightly behind, it thinks it is very behind because alphago can win from reverse direction 90% of the time
robsclone: for b
Falcon89 [5k\]: k6 cut hoping
Kito [?\]: can anyone tell me what a 'moyo' is?
oonicks: so mayb teh best move
Long [?\]: b win this  game, good night so sleepy
Canarmane [-\]: moyo is shape of territory without territory
botBot [?\]: moyo = huge terrorties
USSRMan [3d\]: so the self distruct if it is slightly behind thing is a deep flaw
SamSpade [2d\]: moyo is a big open area
fanweiqi [9d\]: Oh my god alphago won
KoyoToya [-\]: it's a territorial framework kito
mtarn567 [6k\]: moyo is like a framework 
TheBear [9k\]: lol
robsclone: Kito:  http://senseis.xmp.net/?Moyo
Bisqwit [-\]: Kito: Moyo is influence, a framework of your stones facing outwards
Burton [6k\]: moyo is large area of influence that might become territory
geomav [7k\]: study go terms here http://senseis.xmp.net/
Tictactoe [-\]: many go-terms can be found at sensei.xmp.net, bookmark it
Tonight [5k\]: j3 ??? why?
robsclone: fanweiqi ?
Azal [2d\]: fanweiqi wanna share ur thoughts
shahzaib48 [12k\]: moyo is a captured stone.
mtarn567 [6k\]: kinda like making an investment for cash later on. 
Bisqwit [-\]: no
Iniesta [2k\]: j3 protects the corner ?
oscarlai14: moyo is a female name
botBot [?\]: moyo is not captured stone
USSRMan [3d\]: if it makes moves like j3, it thinks it is massively ahead
stokastick [8k?\]: j3 attacks K8
fanweiqi [9d\]: this seems like a conservative move while winning
gogonuts [4d\]: wow
USSRMan [3d\]: in % chance of winning at least
GoIngo [?\]: @fanweiqi: why do you say so now?
gogonuts [4d\]: making fun of b :-)
Hobbes [1k\]: c7
fanweiqi [9d\]: the s9r9... are all sente so there's huge thickness
Chmol [5d\]: should b play j6 or is it much too slow?
aham [7k\]: c8
fanweiqi [9d\]: the middle points is not so large
gogonuts [4d\]: J3 is actually huge
XiJinping2 [2k\]: J3 turns some black territory into white territory (double gain), protects corner a bit more, puts pressure on K8 cut, protects wC7 moyo area 
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol is now intensely reading and calculating the board
aham [7k\]: l10
XiJinping2 [2k\]: J3 is big
Iniesta [2k\]: why gogo nuts ?
fanweiqi [9d\]: i mean, they can't be reduced much
gogonuts [4d\]: c23 does less now too for b
DrSFBrains [1k\]: Can B play C3?
gogonuts [4d\]: c3
XiJinping2 [2k\]: And J3 turns G7 area into potential moyo
urungu [2d\]: j6 would be very slow
fanweiqi [9d\]: Lee will have to make something like yesterday happen again
Bisqwit [-\]: I like that Garlock brought up talk about the handicap system. During slow times, introduce Go concepts to newbies. Assuming there's still any watching the match :)
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Potential moyo is like potential potential territory :)
go7734 [4d\]: j3 also helps the center by making b need to spend more moves defending the cut
mtarn567 [6k\]: hmm w plans for a cut at k6? 
wossname [?\]: isuspect lee considered j3
Blitzbold [2d?\]: potential moyo is more like potential potential
gogonuts [4d\]: if c3 then  c4 d3 b3 
USSRMan [3d\]: the commentator described it as finding the needle in the haystack
Trevoke [?\]: 52k people watching, gotta be at least one beginner in there
wossname [?\]: Just Maybe
XiJinping2 [2k\]: Bisqwit - Garlick is doing just fine as a commentator
USSRMan [3d\]: the one thing alphago missed
wossname [?\]: HE MIght hahve, 
robsclone: true. J3 seems really large, but none of the streams i'm on seem to be so concerned
jellyroll [4k?\]: REdmond is funny...
wossname [?\]: kind of crzy but he might have
wossname [?\]: but i dunno, im just a spectator here
geomav [7k\]: white can easy cut off g12???
Pou7 [2d\]: garlick lol
Azal [2d\]: ke jie left?
Bisqwit [-\]: XiJin: Yeah, some people don't like him, but I agree.
Badduck [2d?\]: i dont get j3
XiJinping2 [2k\]: "Wow. Huh. That's an interesting move." Redmond on the black move just now (not posted yet)
fanweiqi [9d\]: man, this move
Tictactoe [-\]: redmond says europeans 1d will probably win over toppro on H9

fanweiqi [9d\]: alphago is not alphagod

robsclone: i'm not so sure about j11, either
fanweiqi [9d\]: it does not consider everything yet

Rexxar [1k\]: why is black suddenly not favorable anymore?
go7734 [4d\]: black was never favorable
USSRMan [3d\]: it plays like a god, but has the heart of a MC bot
gogonuts [4d\]: empty struggle for b now, imo
DrSFBrains [1k\]: Same question as Rexxar...
Iniesta [2k\]: j3 looks slow

robsclone: Crono9987
Crono9987 [3d\]: thanks :)
Iniesta [2k\]: ke jie very surprised by h3..
Iniesta [2k\]: j3
Julian1d: AlphaGo probably has both bugs / design flaws and a suboptimal neural network. Both are very likely to get fixed, probably within months.
botBot [?\]: Remember. AlphaGo is still a Prototype, its not even in Beta
Canarmane [-\]: G11
Cyphase [?\]: whaa, stream lost 22 seconds
Azal [2d\]: redmon says he fells b has an advantage
]
;W[gi]C[Becubio [4k\]: LSD is trying with simples tesujis, but the one of 78 move was hypercomplex, not like this
GoIngo [?\]: cs eval: 26 % for black now
Julian1d: Humans will likely also get stronger in response. :)
robsclone: Julian1d: but, the "fixing" of the bugs, could introduce more
igoAggie [2k\]: Does CS have all the life and death worked out? 
Iniesta [2k\]: j3 bad for ke jie
Rexxar [1k\]: redmond says b good, i believe redmond
robsclone: i think b is still good, personally
Sabbaticus [6k\]: Can somebody explain to me why crazy stone's evaluation matters? It's only 5 dan and it's a bot, right?
Iniesta [2k\]: center bigger
Azal [2d\]: what says ke jie ?
hugo [1k\]: where can we check CS eval?
aham [7k\]: white has no eye
igoAggie [2k\]: Redmond is much more reliable than CS.
m1m [1k\]: cs might misread right side
robsclone: what b has, they securely have.  w has a lot of things that are potential, but not concrete
botBot [?\]: score estimate dont matter... stop giving the %
GoIngo [?\]: not worked out, but it changes only 8 %
Iniesta [2k\]: j3 odd for ke jie
oscarlai14: Computer value network shows overall ( 100th ) Black 55% White 45%
geomav [7k\]: CS stream shows what it thinks is settled... toggles on occaisionally on stream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60VABUREwOY
Iniesta [2k\]: but not necessarly bad
kadoban [?\]: Sabbaticus: Only because it's easy to ask it and it gives a precise judgement.
leachy [2k\]: exactly sabbaticus but it gives some idea of how alphago is thinking considering it's cousins with crazystone really
Blitzbold [2d?\]: ... for example in game 3 crazystone would have played from move 14 the bad fight for lee the same way than alpha
Yumi [7d\]: link to ke jie stream?
USSRMan [3d\]: its design flaw is the MC heart
robsclone: oh, lol, a crazystone feed
robsclone: interesting
Bisqwit [-\]: I'm not sure I understand how to read that CS screen, even though I can read some Japanese
robsclone: thank you geomav
geomav [7k\]: roger...its a few moves behind
leachy [2k\]: SE is normally reliable but not here
robsclone: Redmond says "I would be worried"
oonicks: thwere is no miai for tesuji
Blitzbold [2d?\]: se is what?
]
;B[gj]C[igoAggie [2k\]: Score estimator. 
Bisqwit [-\]: KGS client feature.
Yumi [7d\]: SE and reliable should never be in the same sentence
Blitzbold [2d?\]: se is normally what?
igoAggie [2k\]: If you settle the life and death on the right you can get an estimate from SE
MMXVI [3k\]: which is invalid for Chinese rules
Baymax [15k?\]: sorry for my silly ddk question, white is dead in the right side?
Iniesta [2k\]: http://sports.letv.com/match/122345003.html#live/1020160303213534
Rexxar [1k\]: w ded
Iniesta [2k\]: ke jie stream
weirdchess [-\]: yes baymax
Blitzbold [2d?\]: ... and se, reliable and chinese scoring...
leachy [2k\]: but SE kills b j16 group as well etc. and gives no points anywhere else
kadoban [?\]: baymax: Yes on the bottom right there.
Azal [2d\]: oscarlai14 how do u know that?? 
Bisqwit [-\]: SE is normally a funny toy that may or may not have value.
weirdchess [-\]: and dont apologize for asking a good question baymax
robsclone: SE seems to give b a +2, if you realize that the top-center b group is not dead
oldguy [4d\]: w is dead

Ephidel [1k\]: whoa
Canarmane [-\]: ouch
USSRMan [3d\]: ke is sharp
robsclone: AG doesn't change "during the match" - so they are tweaking in-between games/
Azal [2d\]: mmmmmm
hio: why do they interview guys during match
Ephidel [1k\]: the corner can still be ko
leachy [2k\]: ? means b can still make ko, no?
Badduck [2d?\]: c6? y ot c5?
hio: stop doing that i want to hear redmond
USSRMan [3d\]: no this is not ko
USSRMan [3d\]: but bad aji
MMXVI [3k\]: to fill the time and inform the viewers, hio
GoIngo [?\]: another homerun move
Kountch [1k\]: no ko at c3?
leachy [2k\]: ok thanks USSRman
Julian1d: Deepmind team monitors AlphaGo's sympathetic nervous system. ;)
jellyroll [4k?\]: seems like b could just lay waste to center.... allow corner?
Bisqwit [-\]: robs: I did not listen, but IIRC they are not tweaking it in between of games.
oonicks: it evaluates teh value of lees moves
glasszee [2k\]: perhaps works better with c10
Deterra [11k?\]: They haven't modified AlphaGo through all 5 games of the match
gogonuts [4d\]: c6 looks fishy through human eyes
Blitzbold [2d?\]: c6 better connection to c10 stones ?
Canarmane [-\]: that's a real big corner for w
oonicks: so that is how it is supposed not to beat players to pulp
robsclone: Bisqwit thank you :) i haven't caught them saying that yet, but was wondering
USSRMan [3d\]: lee might think c3 immedately?
USSRMan [3d\]: as a probe
wossname [?\]: N9 ride or die
hio: Changing AI behavior is too risky
USSRMan [3d\]: n9 was his original plan
hio: and your neuronal network cannot learn big from 4 games
geomav [7k\]: Besides... AG learns by paying millions of games... It can learn from just 3
ntevnwrng [6k?\]: Is b dead at top? or still undecided? 
pipu [5d\]: is there ko in the corner?
go7734 [4d\]: probably
igoAggie [2k\]: I am curious about that myself
Bisqwit [-\]: Yeah, you don't want to make good-intentioned quick fixes that may result in significant drop in the bot's ability because of lack of testing
hio: ntevnsmth> b alive
geomav [7k\]: *cant
paysonfox [9k\]: N9 is in his back pocket, but the C3 invasion or probe looks =good too,
Canarmane [-\]: B is a live, which groul are you thinking?
Blitzbold [2d?\]: b alive on top
jellyroll [4k?\]: c3 or d3
Canarmane [-\]: group*
bruh [4d\]: Yu Changhyuk 9p showed ko in the corner
ffeffsdfef: 0
oldguy [4d\]: I guess Lee is counting
igoAggie [2k\]: Could someone tell us the ko sequence?
mtarn567 [6k\]: b can connect with n13
pipu [5d\]: so corner is 2/3 w terri i guess
stokastick [8k?\]: bruh : what corner ?
robsclone: Bisqwit: lol, that's why I was very interested in if they were trying!  It seems like they're trusting the machine, which i like
bruh [4d\]: bottom left
leachy [2k\]: yes i thought  it was a ko
hio: bottom meft of course
Iniesta [2k\]: w is winning
kadoban [?\]: Bottom left corner? Yeah that's kind of why you usually don't play C6 kind of stuff, though local situation can make the ko not work.
Canarmane [-\]: n13??
igoAggie [2k\]: c3 d3 d2 b2 ?
hio: no way w wins this game
robsclone: inesta: ?
Alekhin: ko is good for b here?
hio: yes
Badduck [2d?\]: maybe reducing w ll is ok for B?
USSRMan [3d\]: hes reading c3 obviously
Eternal6k [4k\]: Only if it lives
hkterry [3d\]: L11 seems better than N9 cutting directly
PaleFire [18k?\]: does C8 work?
robsclone: hmmm
Kountch [1k\]: maybe no ko because of j3
Medieval [2d\]: oh wow
Canarmane [-\]: l11 seems solid but slow?
Medieval [2d\]: this is one of those 3-3 invasion puzzles
Azal [2d\]: l11 seems nice
Iniesta [2k\]: center become smaller
Canarmane [-\]: is l12 better to put a bit mor epressure on the cut point?
alobar [9k\]: welcome the invasion
robsclone: interesting c6.  expected move, but i didn't expect it right now
USSRMan [3d\]: 3-3 invasion will be a probe, see if white trys to kill or make ko
Bisqwit [-\]: CS score estimation screen looks very much like KGS's equivalent. Interesting how it's undecided on the status of R8 and R6
JunLing [1k\]: K13 ? 
Fastnarion [7k\]: haha L11 was already key of previous game :p
hio: c6 does'nt see that expecting to me
Canarmane [-\]: k13 now seems bad i think
Canarmane [-\]: at least at this point
hio: seems*
USSRMan [3d\]: k13 doesnt do anything?
robsclone: definitely not k13
gogonuts [4d\]: i admit that c6 nicely takes b f11 into account
hkterry [3d\]: White can abandon those 3 stones and seal the moyo
jellyroll [4k?\]: not yet on k13... maybe l11?
Canarmane [-\]: if B is playing in w moyo I think l11 or l12 best bet
Blitzbold [2d?\]: if b moves there f11 better than k13 now
Canarmane [-\]: i can't read c3 invade though
USSRMan [3d\]: k13 literally does nothing, why suggest it
m1m [1k\]: b l11 
geomav [7k\]: OH CS is thinking q8 is dead
Julian1d: Aww nice expressions of appreciation between team and commentators.
kaliya [-\]: L11 is a move that would piss off Alpha
Iniesta [2k\]: ke jie recommands l11
papapishu [1d\]: Who can count this position?
gogonuts [4d\]: ke jie wants L11
m1m [1k\]: so alphago has the l11 bug
m1m [1k\]: :)
robsclone: lol
pipu [5d\]: does ke jie still like b? i don't feel like b is ahead...
Blitzbold [2d?\]: omegago could count this
Canarmane [-\]: what stream is ke jie on?
USSRMan [3d\]: i guess n9 no good because white can n10
RyanQu [2d?\]: Kejie is on letv

kaliya [-\]: AHAH the L11 bug

bababobo [1d?\]: t5 could give b some trouble
Ephidel [1k\]: it looks like w has many more ko threats
Iniesta [2k\]: ke jie counted if b l 11
Canarmane [-\]: why is l11 better than l12
G361 [10k\]: ^^
geomav [7k\]: they say many threats in bottom right
USSRMan [3d\]: l12 can be cut
hio: pipu> You see w ahead ? w has nothing yet, one open moyo and one no fixed corner
Falcon89 [5k\]: did Ke jie tell us the next B move?
oonicks: l11 can still cut 
Blitzbold [2d?\]: b cant go for ko i guess with w having so many so big threats
m1m [1k\]: is w playing full strength ? what do ppl say
hio: redmond is counting
kadoban [?\]: 63 or 64 for black, 35 conservatively for white on the right - myungwan kim. Sounds like white has enough in the bottom with komi, they seem to like white's position right now.
robsclone: Redmond's counting points at wL11

robsclone: oh!!
USSRMan [3d\]: then CS is highly unreliable right now
Julian1d: Lee actually asked to play black in game 5, after game 4. :)
go7734 [4d\]: cs estimation function is not related to the cs win % function
go7734 [4d\]: afaik
Canarmane [-\]: b will g5 maybe?
geomav [7k\]: yea CS is lower than reality
robsclone: moyo for that bottom-left-center area huh?
Iniesta [2k\]:  someone asked ke jie where black lost the lead, he responded with J16 + K18 
Canarmane [-\]: i'm confused what Lee is looking for
paysonfox [9k\]: the shape in the lower left is the same as AlPHAGO played against Lee in game 4 --- the double atari is in a similar place too
geomav [7k\]: ko icomplexity?
superpal1 [1d\]: reduced bottom n getting sente to move to l11
robsclone: it looks like he forced AG into battling for the corner, when he was looking to go more center of the board
GoIngo [?\]: even with extra black stone on r7 cs thinks only 35 %

hkterry [3d\]: :o)
leachy [2k\]: heh alekhin that would be awesome
Tictactoe [-\]: aja huang is making the moves for alphago on the board, he is aga 5d for sure, maybe aga 6d
go7734 [4d\]: AG operator is 9d on tygem and strong enough people suspected he was alphago before alphago game 1

hkterry [3d\]: for ajahuang?
hkterry [3d\]: lol

robsclone: Redmond's calling G2

Intagrand [?\]: Crazy said G2 too
leachy [2k\]: barcode, it reduces the white potential here
kadoban [?\]: Not for no reason, this came about due to a reduction/invasion.
Azal [2d\]: g2..
ffeffsdfef: I SAID G2 BEFORE ALL
USSRMan [3d\]: blck should g2
kaliya [-\]: Yes G2, and suddenly Alpha has a weak group in B framework
Canarmane [-\]: g2?
Tictactoe [-\]: but aja huang been modest in tournament inscription too, giving 4d rank to compete in the top macmahonleague in tournaments
Blitzbold [2d?\]: lee is making two weak groups 1 black and 1 white and the reason is to not lose the game

hio: "slighr advantage for b" Redmond
Intagrand [?\]: misquotes
robsclone: js13: i'm pretty interested to see how AlphaGo deals with "amateur" moves
Naphthalin [11k?\]: hio, he said "slight advante" if w played just l11
aham [7k\]: h3
dxxd [1k\]: this seems like The move of the game
Cyphase [?\]: i just realized; Lee has super-hearing and can hear Redmond's commentary
robsclone: does it?
OscarU [2d\]: I think this is a conspiracy,  they didn't put more pressure on AG after they knew they had won the match :P
hio: that's why redmond guess all moves
ivoSF [2d\]: l10 looks flexible
robsclone: hahahaha hio and Cyphase
tjn4fh814: he could as well gopogle the next move
robsclone: that would be silly 
aham [7k\]: h3
Iniesta [2k\]: Ke Jie: could see a trade, but w would still be ahead after that 
Hyaki [6k\]: the cat is hungry
robsclone: worried about this center, now

weiqi5 [3k?\]: Kims only hope is to make some trouble to the K3-group
Julian1d: AlphaGo play is amazing to get to this.
Deterra [11k?\]: This is the closest the clocks have been in all 5 games
Becubio [4k\]: i think b will be disconnected without hope
weiqi5 [3k?\]: Reducing on the right is not enough
Canarmane [-\]: k13 cut is still there which is far bigger
mtarn567 [6k\]: f12? 
Ray [9k?\]: i wish AG would go byoyomi
leachy [2k\]: well, this is a great forcing move....the idea is that now when black e7 f7 e8 et.c

Deterra [11k?\]: It must
GoIngo [?\]: they never lose on time
aham [7k\]: ok he threaten k13
Naphthalin [11k?\]: when they were in byo-yomi, it took 30s per move
kaliya [-\]: K13 now? Mm
kaliya [-\]: J8, rather
hojyosoun [1d\]: who's leading ?
Kobor42 [?\]: What's with the b r7 sequence?
JoostW [7k?\]: hmm
weiqi5 [3k?\]: H7?
DrSFBrains [2k\]: very close
leachy [2k\]: would be funny if the bot lost on time because the guy making the moves on th eboard for it is too slow
weiqi5 [3k?\]: :D
Naphthalin [11k?\]: @kobor: white is dead on the right
aham [7k\]: e6 e7 f7 j3 j4
JoostW [7k?\]: can B gain anything with N9?

kaliya [-\]: If B destroys W moyo in the center, where does Alpha get points?
robsclone: Turnipsi, lol
weiqi5 [3k?\]: AGA president
botBot [?\]: i think game4 was because AlphaGo crashed at some point
kadoban [?\]: Turnipsi: Yeah, pretty much my thoughts.
Kobor42 [?\]: Black is in the territory.
robsclone: Turnipsi: humans can come up with novel play styles, as well
bongo [2k\]: botbot , r u kidding me?
go7734 [4d\]: in the first 4 games lee never had an advantage out of the opening
geomav [7k\]: no 78 was pretty good move
weiqi5 [3k?\]: no, botbot, they just today explained that on Redmond's chanel
robsclone: botBot definitely not
weiqi5 [3k?\]: no hardware problem or anything
weiqi5 [3k?\]: just the OTH problem
weiqi5 [3k?\]: explained on gogameguru
botBot [?\]: OTH?
hojyosoun [1d\]: mg, haylee is there
GoIngo [?\]: cs at 21 % now for black
geomav [7k\]: A thought LS would not play it...did not investigate it enough

KoyoToya [-\]: L11
olivedu13 [1d\]: j 7
blau3: black j7 an option?
botBot [?\]: must k7
KoyoToya [-\]: It reduces and protects the cut
go7734 [4d\]: can make exchange against n9 cut
Canarmane [-\]: j7 doesn't work i don't think
indogo [5k?\]: j7
go7734 [4d\]: but will have to return 
V [3k\]: J7
KoyoToya [-\]: Because Lee could counter cut

KoyoToya [-\]: Oth?
jowzer [2d?\]: K7is a forcing move right?

Kobor42 [?\]: What acronym it is?
GoIngo [?\]: cs: 21 % for black now
weiqi5 [3k?\]: please read comments above!
Canarmane [-\]: now b has threat of cut at n9 to make forcing move like n10

Kobor42 [?\]: I am from mobile, i cant. Could you help pls?
danielhast [3k\]: j7 and n9 miai?
geomav [7k\]: But CS is misreading bottom right
shahzaib48 [12k\]: Wait

danielhast [3k\]: *n10, sorry

blau3: e13
bongo [2k\]: ooops, w moyo reduced? bad bad bad... for hojyosoun, and botbot
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: lds made the redmeond prediocted move
Eilinen [-\]: empty triangle : |
robsclone: with strength, though
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: its a good empty triangle
Canarmane [-\]: empty triangle is good in this case
Canarmane [-\]: really good
robsclone: yeah i'm cool with this
kadoban [?\]: Seems like good timing on that.
blau3: e13 still cuts, no?
Canarmane [-\]: b either keeps those stones and maintains cut threat or else connects to black stones at bot
Canarmane [-\]: its miai
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: not because of being empty trianlg but have to get into the area lower left
botBot [?\]: e13 bad aji
go7734 [4d\]: w will capture at f13
bongo [2k\]: better than bermuda triangle
]
;W[fg]C[botBot [?\]: just capture with f13
go7734 [4d\]: to avoid the forcing moves on the other side
botBot [?\]: yes
robsclone: i am really digging Redmond's commentary
Canarmane [-\]: yup, AG likes simplifying
kadoban [?\]: myungwan is still reading some other variation from forever ago, heh.
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: yes redmond's commentary is excellent
botBot [?\]: AlphaGo is efficient
hojyosoun [1d\]: Kim says b is ahead
Canarmane [-\]: E11

Cyphase [?\]: Redmond: "Oh yea, i got digressed; maybe I was looking at a Go board."

Canarmane [-\]: idk
KoyoToya [-\]: B can f10
DrSFBrains [2k\]: N10
DrSFBrains [2k\]: played

;B[mj]C[robsclone: hehe...this game looks like it's melting Kim Myungwan's brain though
KoyoToya [-\]: And either connect or kill
Canarmane [-\]: there it is
learyghost [3k\]: looks like w is somewhat busted
kadoban [?\]: hojyosoun: Only time I've seen him say that is in a variation (that didn't happen)
hojyosoun [1d\]: can b play R7 ?
bongo [2k\]: oh, kim said so? that's why hojyosoun is crying ....like baby
kaliya [-\]: Good bye W moyo
Kobor42 [?\]: I explained that I can't find the OTH -even on gogameguru, and expanding the words in the acronyms would help greatly. What part of this was unclear for even a second?
KoyoToya [-\]: Bongo
robsclone: ohhh, i like n10
m1m [1k\]: the game seems decided
Canarmane [-\]: no need for r7 at this time?
KoyoToya [-\]: Be polite
python112: B won
hojyosoun [1d\]: kadoban, or maybe i've mitaken, but it seems w moyo is hopeless now
Canarmane [-\]: r7 = 15 miles per hour, n10 = 60 miles per hour
Beleragor [7k\]: hi guy, i just arrived, has Lee got any chance of winning?
kadoban [?\]: It's reduced, not destroyed.
DrSFBrains [2k\]: yes

Cyphase [?\]: absolute-Lee
robsclone: er, she*
robsclone: it
Doli [7k\]: AG resigned in 4 game
KoyoToya [-\]: Yah but bongo the comment about crying was not necessary
Canarmane [-\]: AG resigns if chance of winning is less than 20%
Canarmane [-\]: IIRC
GoIngo [?\]: m10 expected by cs
robsclone: thank you, Doli

;B[li]C[bababobo [1d?\]: Lee does not have enough points for a sure win.
robsclone: and Canarmane :)
Canarmane [-\]: on the contrary, w has not enough points
Turnipsi [1k\]: 20%? AlphaGo being too polite
Canarmane [-\]: w moyo being reduced faster than i can type
KFC [4k?\]: N11 is the next move
geomav [7k\]: Lee is going to wreck white's big terr?
JoostW [7k?\]: 20% is silly
bongo [2k\]: toyo, i thought we can joke
JoostW [7k?\]: how is a 20% chance of winning worse than a 0% chance of winning
Canarmane [-\]: W has to manage his stones life too, this moyo is busted
bongo [2k\]: and freedom of speech too
weiqi5 [3k?\]: Kim: "We have hope!"
JoostW [7k?\]: I thought AG optimized its winning probability...
josh858: 20% means that 20% of the partially random playouts win, right? which means a much lower actual chance of winning
Canarmane [-\]: JoostW, pros often resign when they think they are unlikely to win. It is considered polite/respectful of your opponent's skill
robsclone: i dunno...w's moyo might could recover, conservatively
KoyoToya [-\]: Well it seemed insulting. I'm sorry for misunderstanding bongo

Canarmane [-\]: no, black topcenter is not dead

leachy [2k\]: finally myungwan cedes that alphago may not be an omniscient goddess after all
Turnipsi [1k\]: josh you're probably right, but we can't really know how much
Buddy514 [5k?\]: no, he said Alpha go is not perfect.  clearly stated.  He thinks it did not play optimally.
robsclone: Xylol a few of Lee's moves have seemed challenging his experience of AG weaknesses

RyanQu [2d?\]: lee
kadoban [?\]: Buddy514: That was in response to AJ's question of what it means if white loses this game.
Deterra [11k?\]: Lee Sedol's byo-yomi begin in 30 seconds
Canarmane [-\]: from which direction B respond?
robsclone: lee's into his minutes
Turnipsi [1k\]: I guess the programmers can set the percentage so that it stops before playing silly ataris, whatever percentage that means
Canarmane [-\]: Go up to n12?
Quaternion [4k\]: a 30min l 7min
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol enters byoyomi
Canarmane [-\]: or more conservative?
Kaidjin [?\]: Guess the next move ! http://gomoveguesser.ab0.fr
Buddy514 [5k?\]: I didn't hear that... I will have to go back and listen then if you are right.

hojyosoun [1d\]: good site, thank you Kaidjin
USSRMan [3d\]: close game
Deterra [11k?\]: Much closer than the last 4!
kadoban [?\]: Buddy514: The rest of his response makes it sounds like he'd probably agree to that anyway out of context, but ... it was different than an unprompted quote, IMO.

IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: even though at 7k my opinion doesnt matter
Dantek [1d\]: sedol leads by 5 or more
robsclone: hmm
Nam [-\]: b9 good
robsclone: maybe he's reaching into D8ish
MrChips [1k\]: w cant play m12 yet, since it ends in gote. if b ends this sequence in sente hes good

DrSFBrains [2k\]: I hope that the players get more time in their overtimes next match...
robsclone: eek @Kim's reaction to b
kadoban [?\]: Kim thought black should play N12 instead.
mtarn567 [6k\]: g5 sets up some nice reduction will have to respond or lose either g4 or k3.   after which b can play e6 with damezumari on f6
go7734 [4d\]: s15 and m12 are big
botBot [?\]: n12 so huge
weiqi5 [3k?\]: the point is: Kim thinks that the white left can anyway reduced by some complicated combination

;B[aj]C[kadoban [?\]: Yeah, F6 and H3
Canarmane [-\]: i dont' think b can get n12 in sente
robsclone: hmm
Canarmane [-\]: were i W i'd just takeit now
leachy [2k\]: feels like there's some nice move here for black like f7 or something which might explain why lee didn't n12 yet
dehuong [1k\]: who is winning?
kadoban [?\]: He can't get N12 in sente, but kim is saying that the left can be reduced anyway after white blocks at B10 (without black's B9 there)
Dantek [1d\]: black
blau3: f10 turning into bad aji for W, too
hojyosoun [1d\]: dehuong, Kim said b is winning, but he also mention that b9 is mistake
botBot [?\]: b10 was bad?
robsclone: eh
DrSFBrains [2k\]: I just realized that N9 is a move ... Not big enough yet, but ...
dehuong [1k\]: Redmond said that's good

Becubio [3k\]: C19 imposible for b
JoostW [7k?\]: except it's counted with japanese rules
Cyphase [?\]: ~796 observers atm
pipu [5d\]: I guess bot has been in control for a while
reym2: at game 4 the rigt move for aphago was hidden because of the ko (very narrow tree of winning positions) and the ladder (very broad tree of fake winning positions), but it didn't happen here
geomav [7k\]: gonna count chinese
weiqi5 [3k?\]: LSD resigned
o0key [9k\]: w+12.5
Gotham88 [4k\]: wow how did he managed to count so well.

IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: might as well play to end
Tictactoe [-\]: Lee has resigned ? lost on time?
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: get real count
Eternal6k [4k\]: 800 peeps
Ephidel [1k\]: b 38 points bottom right; 11 top right; 3 top; 10 points left + 14 captures = 76 total. white has 27 bottom; 13 top+mid; 16 points right + 18 +7.5 = 81.5

GoIngo [?\]: thx to tictactoe for transmission
Krellan [22k?\]: Wow, he must have read it all out and realized a loss?
Gotham88 [4k\]: it's a close game
weiqi5 [3k?\]: I think he should have counted
Krellan [22k?\]: The closest game yet
LEIBNIZ [2k\]: wow! great game, thanks TTT
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: poor le sedol
degsi: w+r
highhand [5k\]: where to find post game analysis on this site?
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: look so tired
weiqi5 [3k?\]: would have made better press :(
kadoban [?\]: Lee has known it was a loss for quite a while I'm sure.
Kolie34A: :(
BigDoug [-\]: thanks TTT
tempay [2k?\]: man he looks sad

crate [-\]: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
musmos [6d\]: this was a historic game
Tictactoe [-\]: You saw tears in sedols eyes regretting a move around l12
rs220675 [2d\]: what makes this loss so bad is that he lost a won game
crate [-\]: finnish stop pre winning you stupid counters
highhand [5k\]: post game analysis where to find here?
arcturus [2k?\]: RIP
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: at least lee won 1
IIIllIIll0 [7k\]: we humans have our consolation prize
robsclone: that's what gets me, is that it was won
Kolie34A: will ke jie challenge alphago
zihao [1k\]:  
robsclone: "won" - i mean
crate [-\]: counting again so stupid ruined it
tjn4fh814: press conference will folow ..
Turnipsi [1k\]: <5 point edge in fuseki hardly counts as a won game yet, even on pro level
TheBear [9k\]: Welp time for Ke Jie to smash the bot
ZeNit [?\]: Ke Jie is our next great hope
SamuBlaa [7k\]: at least lee sedol won one game
pipu [5d\]: Ke Jie will save the human race!!
geomav [7k\]: THANKS TTT
musmos [6d\]: ke jie challnage ag already
robsclone: oh, poor Lee.  i want to see the official count - we get an official count right?
musmos [6d\]: waiting response from google team
Eisenmann [4k\]: I'm so disappoint..
GodofGo [6d\]: ke jie will lose lol
kadoban [?\]: Thanks for the fun all, cya next series.
robsclone: tictactoe thank you!
robsclone: see ya, kadoban
SamuBlaa [7k\]: i was hoping that lee sedol would've won the challenge but oh well
Kolie34A: thanks a lot,bye!
Eisenmann [4k\]: Thks tictactoe. ;)
Gotham88 [4k\]: you mean ke jie will ply against this next?
robsclone: i'm actually very surprised
SamuBlaa [7k\]: alphago is so strong
chudu [2k\]: Kejie has challenged AG?
TheBear [9k\]: Thank you Tictactoe for relaying
BlackSmurf [2k?\]: Tes chudu
ZeNit [?\]: Thanks Tictactoe
Cyphase [?\]: so final score?
AutoAtari [2k?\]: Ke Jie will be utterly destroyed, as the deep mind team will fix the discovered weaknesses in the meantime
highhand [5k\]: like to talk to admin regarding this game, any around?
SamuBlaa [7k\]: what were the weaknesses
SamuBlaa [7k\]: ?
Tictactoe [-\]: Thank you all for the support finding the moves
narugo [1d\]: Ke Jie has harder time, but atleast he dont underestimate aplpha and can try some special vs computer tactics
AutoAtari [2k?\]: one is that it didn't use enough time in difficult situations in game 4
juggler [?\]: the weakness is that it can overlook impossible tesuji :)
robsclone: there didn't really seem to be any so-obvious ones @SamuBlaa
AutoAtari [2k?\]: so it didn't have time to read unusual moves
MrGimbap [12k?\]: so what now about alphago .. another game with humans ?
robsclone: not during the play, at least. a few odd moves, but
oHo [14k\]: bye
AutoAtari [2k?\]: another one is that it doesn't seem to know standard but long forced sequences
crate [-\]: like always they did'nt score the game
mfg: score it yourself.
Doli [7k\]: How many points white was leading?
Cyphase [?\]: psh, i could have won
robsclone: i'm cheering for you, Cyphase
Cody [2k\]: A bit sad that there's no scoring -- there are thousands of people watching go for the first time and they can't even see how a game ends with scoring. 
crate [-\]: no I should have to they have a official ref... for that
crate [-\]: and for the viewers
robsclone: i agree Cody
AutoAtari [2k?\]: they might get scared by the Chinese counting though :p
grolich [-\]: 2.5 
grolich [-\]: it seems
Bisqwit [-\]: Yeah, if they do see counting I would so prefer they see Japanese counting.
Slain [3k\]: btw, how is SE miscalculating so much at this stage of the game?
oonicks: likewise in winning a lost game..
Doli [7k\]: Thanks.
GodofGo [6d\]: it messes up chinese rules
santiago [2d\]: SE doesnt work with chinese scoring
AutoAtari [2k?\]: SE is just totally wrong for Chinese rules
Slain [3k\]: ic
crate [-\]: W+15
Tictactoe [-\]: W +2.5 on the board
Slain [3k\]: yeah, 2.5 was my count too
AutoAtari [2k?\]: W+2.5 if he gets c19
Cody [2k\]: If you view offline and change scoring to Japanese, you'll get a more accurate count
Hollowb55 [12k\]: wow ty for the gme!
AutoAtari [2k?\]: omg, I'm calling it "he" :p
blinry [9k?\]: I'm calling her "her".
AutoAtari [2k?\]: yeah, Kim Myungwan does too, he's somewhat in love
leachy [2k\]: it's a machine....therefore not animate therefore 'it'
Slain [3k\]: Yeah, some moves really seemed like they came from a woman ;p j/k
robsclone: hahaha Slain
BigDoug [-\]: stop the sexist comments
leachy [2k\]: don't assign machines properties they don't have
leachy [2k\]: e14 c19 should be the end
robsclone: i think it was kind of fun that they made it tha way.  Even Redmond personified AG, often.  Speaking of intention and worry and assumption
narugo [1d\]: yep w+2.5
juggler [?\]: even hassabis himself
nhanho [3d?\]: w+2.5 is after komi right?
nhanho [3d?\]: (too lazy to count)
AutoAtari [2k?\]: it does simulate the human way of thinking and learning
BigDoug [-\]: I'm referring to the comment about moves which women make
USSRMan [3d\]: Very interesting game
narugo [1d\]: yes after komi
USSRMan [3d\]: Alphago thinks it played bad in opening, but made a catchup by endgame
AutoAtari [2k?\]: b8 was kinda questionable?
robsclone: it seemed to think it was losing, at some point. when the weird moves briefly appeared
AutoAtari [2k?\]: yeah it was cool to see alphago come back after those weird moves, and snatch a win
oonicks: i counted lee ahead all the way untill it enclosed 8 pts around h5
robsclone: interesting
AutoAtari [2k?\]: maybe it was trying to throw off Lee Sedol? :p
narugo [1d\]: black sould have get time to play j3 first
robsclone: that territory could look like the exact right amount to lose/win on
narugo [1d\]: g16 or someting secuence ended for gote
physics [2k\]: Who won
r0n1n [2d\]: W+ ~2.5
physics [2k\]: Wow
robsclone: it was a fight
crate [-\]: B+0.5
js13 [1k\]: did lee resign? or count the score? missed a while
gocrazy432 [8k\]: resign
robsclone: lee resigned :-/  we dont' get an official count, it looks like
oonicks: also when it played m9 i thought it was sure it had won
js13 [1k\]: wat? ok thx
robsclone: but the +w ~2.5 seems close
Turnipsi [1k\]: w was comfortably ahead with its moyo, even surviving the huge loss of e7 stones connecting
USSRMan [3d\]: Demis Hassabis Twitter
js13 [1k\]: gg for lee sedol
USSRMan [3d\]: He thinks AlphaGo made a huge comeback from an inital setback
robsclone: how long has it been taking for the conference?
robsclone: i'm so sleepy
Turnipsi [1k\]: wchich means this is what AlphaGo thinks what happened
oonicks: i even wonder if it did on purpose:)
robsclone: i'm gonna have to catch teh convference, tomor])
(;W[pk]
;B[qm]
;W[cb]C[Buddy514 [5k?\]: actually, they said yesterday that you have to remove stones before your turn ends according to koreaan rules.
herissondu [3d\]: it's korean counting, everything can happen
Starstorm3 [4d\]: can we get AlphaGo's Value neural net to replace SE? I feel like it's pretty bgood

(;W[pn]C[oonicks: yep

;B[oo]
;W[ro]
;B[sn]TR[pk][qk][rk]C[oonicks: problem is, to miss it you must have seen it two moves before ..
Tictactoe [-\]: white secured shibori
oonicks: dunno
Tictactoe [-\]: you got controle
oonicks: not needed i just ened to think then
oonicks: and perhaps a clone
oonicks: its in help room
