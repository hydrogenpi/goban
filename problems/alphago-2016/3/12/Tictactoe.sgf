Patrick314 [?\]: There was a Reddit thread where he mentioned that Cho Hyeyeon would be joining him for the stream
cata [2k\]: awesome
killrbunny [3k\]: I *really* wonder if alphaGo is using millions of processors... it would explain why it plays so much better now...
Rinnon [5k?\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLqYmG7hTraZA7v9Hpbps0QNmJC4L1NE3S&v=qUAmTYHEyM8
cata [2k\]: given that alphago published their results, if they were lying about how the performance scaled with hardware someone is going to catch them on it pretty soon
cheyenne [8k\]: It's not millions of processors.  I suspect it was loaded with more pro games (probably from Korea)
cata [2k\]: it doesn't seem like lying would serve a purpose
oonicks: in a sense, when the processors it uses use millions of others would that be cheating?
cheyenne [8k\]: Alphago has two modes, single and distributed.  According to the research paper, in single mode it uses 40 search threads, 48 CPUs and 8 GPUs.  In distributed mode it still uses 40 search threads, but it is spread across 1202 CPUs and 176 GPUs 
cheyenne [8k\]: Even in single mode, it was able to beat all the other Go AI programs (zen, crazy stones, etc.)
cheyenne [8k\]: http://www.scribd.com/doc/302719734/AlphaGo-Paper
njs [1d\]: GOOD LUCK ALPHAGO
njs [1d\]: YOU"LL NEED IT HHAHAHAHA
njs [1d\]: So what are your predictions on the first move
njs [1d\]: q16?
njs [1d\]: maybe p16
wikipwnia [3k\]: k10
killrbunny [3k\]: ...back... why would they? To win? And then admit it... 
wikipwnia [3k\]: mirror go up until move 177 - heard it first here everybody
superpal1 [1d\]: 4 more mins?
Burton [6k\]: 3 hours each for this game??
njs [1d\]: i want lee sedol to play p15 lol
superpal1 [1d\]: he play t19
njs [1d\]: Where does it say 3 hours each?
killrbunny [3k\]: They would be gracious and give Lee back face by owning up to using millions of processors...
njs [1d\]: t18 is better @superpal
rsun [-\]: you already know lee sedol's taking black?
Burton [6k\]: time control???
fdasdsfa: they have 2 hours each
njs [1d\]: 120 minutes is 2 hour
njs [1d\]: 1 hour is 60 minutes
killrbunny [3k\]: Burton: it's on the screen!!  In RED@
robsclone: we all ready?
Burton [6k\]: lol sorry
superpal1 [1d\]: i got my popcorn
Weirdsel [4k?\]: yep they can start :D
Vortex [-\]: he is taking black, it alternates except for the last game
njs [1d\]: ^
killrbunny [3k\]: So funny how hard it is to find stuff on the screen when you're not used to looking at it...
Trevoke [?\]: Tengen opening? 
njs [1d\]: hopefully tengen
njs [1d\]: alphago will be scared
royu [4d\]: tengen tenge tengen!
Azal [2d\]: It seems that Lee has a strategy to beat AG
Tictactoe [-\]: Goodday viewers, i hope we can all enjoy this third match. I hope i got the colours right
Azal [2d\]: "Lee Sedol and his juniors pulled an all-nighter searching for a "secret weapon" to beat AlphaGo. "
BrentoBox [4k\]: Probably gonna play tengen
BrentoBox [4k\]: Yeah, tengen
rockoac [5k\]: yeah
njs [1d\]: lee stayed up all night for this
rsun [-\]: I think they usually do nigiri every odd number game
njs [1d\]: he'll be really tired
rockoac [5k\]: did he realy
miai [1d\]: I bet on Lee Sedol
BLikeWater [3d\]: this just in, Ke jie is actually playing against Lee
Bovido [6k\]: mirror match

ausrussell [4k\]: Hope there's a start on the edge
miai [1d\]: good morning
njs [1d\]: How about r17?
rsun [-\]: what about game 5?
leblond [4k\]: bonjour
njs [1d\]: salut
c137: IMO next game they should get like 5 top pro's vs alphago collaborative match with 10h + 20x120s byo
rockoac [5k\]: Alpha go will win 5-0
Vortex [-\]: I'm not sure exactly but it's either nigiri or random or something like that
ausrussell [4k\]: 5s
rsun [-\]: ok
robsclone: i would like that. that sounds very interesting
rsun [-\]: here it comes
rockoac [5k\]: 8:00 people
rockoac [5k\]: !!!!
miai [1d\]: lol
njs [1d\]: We got this Kibitz!!
oonicks: in theory maybe lee could play r15 perfectly but my guess is he will play q16
robsclone: think Lee's sick of it, or is he ready to kic kbutt
uberaji [?\]: I want a robot like Chappie physically placing the stones for alphago
ausrussell [4k\]: Was Lee just praying
njs [1d\]: They should do a collaboration match with KGS kibitz vs alphago
njs [1d\]: we win for sure
leblond [4k\]: bonne chance Lee
Azal [2d\]: link of ke jie channel ?
wikipwnia [3k\]: question: what is the stream for myungwan kim
Tictactoe [-\]: correct colours, game starts
AnthonyC [3k\]: go lee
njs [1d\]: AGA go channel - will start at 9 i think
miai [1d\]: how did you know the colours!!!
robsclone: I think Kim is on the AGS feed
robsclone: or will be. i think he was one hour into it, last time
Penfold [5k?\]: Humanity's last stand
Vortex [-\]: the colours are alternating until the last game miai
hgfh: the critical game
AnthonyC [3k\]: Ke Jie is humanity last stand lol
Tictactoe [-\]: 35 years of experience made my guess acuurate
jellyroll: GO LEE!
Cilien [-\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUAmTYHEyM8
Trevoke [?\]: Q16

;B[pd]C[njs [1d\]: I knew it
mapuche27 [4k\]: buena suerte!!
killrbunny [3k\]: lol
Kitani: vamos que se puede!!!
hgfh: I don't think Ke Jie is stronger than Lee by much
Dom [6d\]: time to play sanrensei
njs [1d\]: probably d3
superpal1 [1d\]: first move lee already drinking wate
njs [1d\]: lol superpal he's tired and nervous
rsun [-\]: difference between alpha and lee is much more significant than ke and lee
hgfh: If Lee lost all matches, I'd at most bet on Ke: Alpha 1:4
tugkaneren [2d\]: Which side is b
miai [1d\]: what is computer thinking...
Eternal6k [4k\]: Let's go Lee!
miai [1d\]: lee sedol black
Chubi [-\]: miai , damn i wish i knew
Eternal6k [4k\]: Lee black
njs [1d\]: Go alphago! beat all these measly humans!
iskatel [3k\]: 加油!!!
a1328 [3k\]: who created alphaGO?
superpal1 [1d\]: lee goes for influence
Azal [2d\]: someone know ke jie link?
Codexus [7k?\]: Good morning!
robsclone: boooo alphaGo
]
;W[pp]C[c137: I wonder if they picked LSD because stylistically AG might be more vulnerable to someone liek Gu Li
superpal1 [1d\]: so is alphago
GoIngo [?\]: morning codexus
njs [1d\]: d4
baltimore [4k?\]: someone's gotta teach that bot some manners!
Falcon89 [5k\]: google created alphaGO
lurrch [?\]: Alphago trying to psyche out
SpicySpice [12k\]: why does it not show the timer ticking down?
oonicks: my literary vein starts bleeding
]
;B[cd]C[gooooo [-\]: bad manner alphago
njs [1d\]: because he is simulating it on kgs
superpal1 [1d\]: kobayashi incoming
njs [1d\]: time controls dont change
w1zzle [7k\]: Which color is who
superpal1 [1d\]: lee is b
njs [1d\]: look up
SpicySpice [12k\]: White is Alpha
MrSparkle [22k?\]: white is AG
miai [1d\]: lee sedol black
adancassan [13k\]: Hi guys! And thanks TTT for this!

;W[dp]C[Penfold [5k?\]: What is the hardware behind AlphaGo?
miai [1d\]: and computer is white
ausrussell [4k\]: Black is also melacholy

;B[cn]C[njs [1d\]: c6
MrSparkle [22k?\]: distributed AG, it's a lot of hardware
MrSparkle [22k?\]: not just a PC
BLikeWater [3d\]: forget but it's insane. dont expert ur home version anytime soon
njs [1d\]: I'm predicting f3 d10 f17 j17 
DemonStyle [3d?\]: Nearly 2000 CPUs, supposedly.
Meloe [-\]: Motoki is not awake
aham [9k\]: F3
feeldabern [4d\]: f3 j17 i bet
mapuche27 [4k\]: takemiya masaki can win to alphago, with his cosmic style... ^^
rsun [-\]: alpha f3 for sure
lemur [9k?\]: Lee's playing the multiple machine/distributed version
yoyoma [3d\]: 1,920 CPUs + 280 GPUs
lemur [9k?\]: there are 1900 cpus and 300 gpus
miai [1d\]: I like this opening as black
feeldabern [4d\]: lee has a lot of practice with f3 j17 from his match with gu li
highhand [5k\]: 2000 cpu is not 2000 times 1 cpu
njs [1d\]: Kobayashi declined then feeldabern
]
;W[fq]C[hgfh: 李師傅 唔好同佢搏拳 嘗試切佢電源
miai [1d\]: b4
DemonStyle [3d?\]: I assume each CPU is mutli-core, yes
miai [1d\]: come on
SpicySpice [12k\]: highland why not?
feeldabern [4d\]: j17 is the same as happened many times against gu li
c137: It's somewhere around 10k cores from what Iw as reading
njs [1d\]: b4 so bad lol
miai [1d\]: k16
aham [9k\]: E6 for change
]
;B[id]C[gooooo [-\]: fanweiqi, you need to tell them to give the bot manners about corners so lee doesnt have to stretch across the board
rsun [-\]: here comes moyo
njs [1d\]: j16 so  he wants moyo
feeldabern [4d\]: ah not j17 but j16
Azal [2d\]: high chineese
miai [1d\]: this is very different
DonValley [6d?\]: is there a link for a gu li's or chinese commentary?
ruby [2d\]: wow
Sweetrip [9d\]: for god's sake
oonicks: influence lesson.. i am scared
njs [1d\]: hey it's sweetrip
Hikky [-\]: cool.
highhand [5k\]: w tengen :)
ruby [2d\]: w passes
Sweetrip [9d\]: i would burn $500 right now
MrSparkle [22k?\]: from the paper, 1200 CPUs (running the tree search) and 176 GPUs (running the neural nets) against Fan Hui, no idea what it could be now
HeartXiao [3k\]: High chinese?
Sweetrip [9d\]: if i can be guaranteed lee sedol will not be shut out
miai [1d\]: yes!
aham [9k\]: d14
HeartXiao [3k\]: this seems pretty uncommon
Chubi [-\]: whats high chinese?
njs [1d\]: it's an opening
miai [1d\]: lol
gooooo [-\]: sweetrip, power outage? ;)
Tictactoe [-\]: same hardware MrSparkle
superpal1 [1d\]: c16 j16 q16 
rsun [-\]: top 3 black stones
HeartXiao [3k\]: the top formation is the high chinese
Falcon89 [5k\]: all  3 on 4th line
robsclone: lee's looking good so far
Trevoke [?\]: r14 
Bursar [1d\]: http://live.le.com/sports/play/index.shtml?type=zb&id=1020160303212747
SpicySpice [12k\]: Is the tree search basically standard look N moves ahead?
Chubi [-\]: sorry im beggining 
]
;W[qf]C[Sweetrip [9d\]: power outage, please
njs [1d\]: r14
HeartXiao [3k\]: the standard chinese is j17
miai [1d\]: Lee Se Dol is that correct?
Sweetrip [9d\]: they will just reschedule the match
rsun [-\]: lee sedol thinking if he should r15 like alpha
njs [1d\]: r11
Sweetrip [9d\]: playing all the moves up to the point of adjourment
Anatoly [2d?\]: guys, does anyone have the link to the unlisted YouTube stream which shows Lee Sedol and the board for the whole time?
MrSparkle [22k?\]: It's Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which kind of does a statistical look-ahead
feeldabern [4d\]: probably no r15 here
SpicySpice [12k\]: ah okay
cheyenne [8k\]: The tree search is a monte carlo tree search
feeldabern [4d\]: maybe a pincer
njs [1d\]: r15 is iffy here
Sweetrip [9d\]: anonymous
njs [1d\]: I'm thinking a two space pincer
Sweetrip [9d\]: or north korea
robsclone: SpicySpice - there is also pattern-matching. it's supposed to have a sense of aji, by visual patterns
Sweetrip [9d\]: infect alphago's servers
SpicySpice [12k\]: so do you know how it weighs the tree-search vs the Neural network?
superpal1 [1d\]: o16 q10 
Eternal6k [4k\]: R15 bad shape
aham [9k\]: need to play very impolite with this policy bot
SpicySpice [12k\]: since theyre run separetly
HeartXiao [3k\]: r12 
Falcon89 [5k\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLqYmG7hTraZA7v9Hpbps0QNmJC4L1NE3S&v=qUAmTYHEyM8
Nam [-\]: q12 or r12
oonicks: far pincer f6
miai [1d\]: lee drunk something from the glass
njs [1d\]: q11
njs [1d\]: Since moyo
oonicks: r<
mapuche27 [4k\]: ha ha, north korea infect alphago servers... ha ha
cheyenne [8k\]: however, the search is feed from a neural net that has been trained to return moves that a human might select
HeartXiao [3k\]: q12 is not really a move
ausrussell [4k\]: he holds his cup in an interesting way
Tictactoe [-\]: audience numbers slowly rising to 300 already
feeldabern [4d\]: if pincer r12 is most likely
ixido [8k\]: is the rocking unusual?
edlee [1k\]: Tictactoe, Thanks :)
feeldabern [4d\]: becasue then b can play q17 with no issue
Kitty [2d\]: I hope he pincer
rsun [-\]: isn't o16 only move
GoIngo [?\]: thx tictactoe !
aham [9k\]: L3
njs [1d\]: no, q11 is the only move
oonicks: i dont hope he plays close to t14
bryamatt [11k\]: yeah thanks for hosting all the games Tictactoe!
feeldabern [4d\]: r12 r17 q17 is a move, or o16
Trevoke [?\]: o17 
]
;B[nc]C[Nam [-\]: o16 q10 q12?
feeldabern [4d\]: oh did o17
feeldabern [4d\]: interesting
miai [1d\]: o17
njs [1d\]: lool
sprouts [1d\]: S14 plz!
HeartXiao [3k\]: i don't think o17 works well with j16
HeartXiao [3k\]: i mean
njs [1d\]: q10 probably now
MrSparkle [22k?\]: hmm...KGS is ahead of the stream for me right now
HeartXiao [3k\]: o16
miai [1d\]: very interesting move
hgfh: hope Lee back his aggressive mode
HeartXiao [3k\]: o17 works better
njs [1d\]: I feel liek alphago instead of q10 will play some random move
Trevoke [?\]: MrSparkle : check that you're still live, I've found sometimes the stream stops being live for me
MrGimbap [12k?\]: yep thanks a lot tictactoe, Iam on the other side of the world with a lowwwest connexion ever. can't watch youtube. I am glad you show it here
rsun [-\]: it will play some kami no itte after b makes a moyo
oonicks: yes.. defence , brilliant repertoire
Trevoke [?\]: MrSparkles: I use this https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=qUAmTYHEyM8
feeldabern [4d\]: tenuki is coming
GoIngo [?\]: it does not mean much, but Crazy Stone is at 47 % for Black here
robsclone: i agree with the "some sort of random move"
Trevoke [?\]: r7 
kdbaby14 [6k\]: today Lee plays seem very safe
BLikeWater [3d\]: O.o
ithisa [25k\]: R7
robsclone: it seems like AlphaGo can play something that seems odd, but it can fight so it makes the odd move good
BLikeWater [3d\]: !
njs [1d\]: What the heck is r7
miai [1d\]: r7
ithisa [25k\]: R7
miai [1d\]: omg
Tictactoe [-\]: i had some lag on the website, i wonder how many are watching  there on youtube
njs [1d\]: Weirdest move i have ever seen
glasszee [2k\]: joseki?
ithisa [25k\]: I'm watching
royu [4d\]: gg, alpha wins 
a1328 [3k\]: EVERYBODY  here Not play
miai [1d\]: doomsday move
njs [1d\]: besides the Ear-reddening move
kdbaby14 [6k\]: wtf is R-7
rsun [-\]: r7 is great move
feeldabern [4d\]: r7 interesting
Eternal6k [4k\]: Y'all asked for a random move
]
;W[qm]C[ithisa [25k\]: r7
Eternal6k [4k\]: That stone will kill a dragon
Trevoke [?\]: Redmond says this is common, but strange to see it played as W
njs [1d\]: lee already losing now
Eternal6k [4k\]: Watch
adoreme [3d\]: 25.500 viewers in the Deepmind Stream 
Prodigious [-\]: not that unusual
edlee [1k\]: Tictactoe, whenever youtube lags, just refresh your tab -- it syncs up then
royu [4d\]: lee needed to play r7 instead of o17 ^^
feeldabern [4d\]: it's more often with a 3-4 shimari
drueknmstr [3d\]: alphago's weird moves are moves that see 100 moves in advance
Trevoke [?\]: This move tends to invite a fight around q11 which is considered good for B
feeldabern [4d\]: but still conceivable
hgfh: http://www.douyutv.com/533882 <--Chinese streaming, Gu Li's commentary again
njs [1d\]: It's unusual for white iirc Prodigious
Tictactoe [-\]: i did ofcourse
ithisa [25k\]: or press the "Live" button lol
superpal1 [1d\]: l3?
aham [9k\]: l3
Burton [6k\]: maybe alphago better at fights than deciding on open area moves
SpicySpice [12k\]: what is the point of O 17?
ithisa [25k\]: or use 240p
MrSparkle [22k?\]: Trevoke thanks for the gaming link!
kdbaby14 [6k\]: R-7 is extremely not human
miai [1d\]: white looks better already!
oonicks: yes this white is not bad i like r7 as well
SpicySpice [12k\]: it feels like his stones are too close together, not that I really know ofc
royu [4d\]: r7 is KGS human
aham [9k\]: n5
drueknmstr [3d\]: this is anticipating an exchange of bottom left corner for top right corner on move 108 of the game
Weirdsel [4k?\]: white doesn't look better....
robsclone: i think the whack moves are still whack moves. just ones that attention to detali and local-reading can overcome
rsun [-\]: d10 is most likely
kdbaby14 [6k\]: W seems spread out better than B
]
;B[dj]C[ithisa [25k\]: redmond guessed d10 lol
Eternal6k [4k\]: D10
njs [1d\]: no
aham [9k\]: berk!
glasszee [2k\]: royu, it couldve been someone here right now who instilled this into Alphago's training data :D
kdbaby14 [6k\]: D-10 is nice
Trevoke [?\]: Haha Redmond said "in the beginning of the game, we (pros) are basically just guessing"
rsun [-\]: now alpha may do some special stuff
kdbaby14 [6k\]: pretty "sedol-style"
njs [1d\]: most could guess d10 lol
hgfh: Lee is ready to fight
rsun [-\]: E15 would be really special
Azal [2d\]: q3
iskatel [3k\]: what a goood game ))
njs [1d\]: watch alphago play like d13
miai [1d\]: because there is not only one move in the opening
adfafdsfaf: K4
azblueeyes [8k\]: i have played r7 tons of times in my 5000 games on gokgs....sorry alphago
Sweetrip [9d\]: p14
Azal [2d\]: watch out... e11
royu [4d\]: Google engineer: "After researching where r7 came from, it seems AlphaGo was pulling from the games of a player named 'Iamdick'"

njs [1d\]: d14
a1328 [3k\]: if leesedol lost this game,,,, the game over?
njs [1d\]: is the only move 
MageKnight [?\]: they will play all 5 games
ithisa [25k\]: a1328: no they are going to play 5 regardless
MrSparkle [22k?\]: do they play all 5 games regardless?
MrSparkle [22k?\]: oh ok
HeartXiao [3k\]: the numbering on the stream and the numbering on kgs is flipped around 
ithisa [25k\]: lee sedol gets paid for every game he wins

drueknmstr [3d\]: our comments are like fleas on the dog to alphago
superpal1 [1d\]: b play catiously
ithisa [25k\]: yeah, like 20ks commenting on pro match

rsun [-\]: e13 not alphago enough
ithisa [25k\]: tengen
BLikeWater [3d\]: sai!
cheyenne [8k\]: So.. the real question.  Is alphago watching this board to get suggetions for moves :grin:
rsun [-\]: lol

njs [1d\]: so alphago is not real druekn ? :P

;W[eg]C[Long [?\]: this is not alpha enough

oonicks: cclassic in fact and no one guessed;)

Kitani: ups
lurrch [?\]: I have never seen any joseki like this
kdbaby14 [6k\]: the fight is up

miai [1d\]: looks like it's gonna be like second game, lots of fight in center
kdbaby14 [6k\]: it is a joseki
njs [1d\]: Sweetrip why wouldnt black cut at f13...
manta [3d\]: is d15 possible?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: just rare
Tictactoe [-\]: yes this has been played before

XiJinping2 [2k?\]: Where is the Korean language stream of AlphaGo game 3?
Long [?\]: this is heinan style joseki 
rsun [-\]: alpha teaching us new lesson again
drueknmstr [3d\]: dont go gently into the night lee sedol
Sweetrip [9d\]: because my neural network tells me the cut is very very bad
Long [?\]: aka sai
njs [1d\]: Lol
]
;W[de]C[kali15 [4k\]: d15??
miai [1d\]: I like the computer more because he is a winner
Long [?\]: wow
Anatoly [2d?\]: does anyone have the link to the unlisted YouTube stream which shows Lee Sedol and the board for the whole time?
rsun [-\]: this is definitely new
watchingo: this is not expected
cutcutcut: spicy: r7 is just like r6, but more greedy.. it leaves the corner more thin (the stones are further away so there are more potential for black to mess with it)
njs [1d\]: d14
HeartXiao [3k\]: allowing a cut like this feels so wrong...
bert [?\]: link to redmonds commentary, please
rsun [-\]: completely anti-textbook
blau3: (Hi from Europe, 05:17 CET here)
watchingo: redmond's commentary is main deepmind stream
kdbaby14 [6k\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUAmTYHEyM8
ithisa [25k\]: Japanese stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZtZdAaInEM
rsun [-\]: redmond gonna fall off his chair when he sees this move
HeartXiao [3k\]: this is completely against conventional wisdom...
Sweetrip [9d\]: lee sedol does not have a chance
gooooo [-\]: blau3, hi from sweden
bert [?\]: thanks
njs [1d\]: See if people didn't know that alphago was playing, they wuld think d15 was a 12k move
HeartXiao [3k\]: allowing a cut of the keima 
miai [1d\]: weird
robsclone: right, njs?
Penfold [5k?\]: obvious move looks obvious
HeartXiao [3k\]: the fact that white is playing a move like this scares the hell out of me
bitzi [-\]: gu li says this is a possible move
rsun [-\]: redmond seems very calm
Eternal6k [4k\]: D14?
robsclone: i'm interested in some disconnected commentary
aham [9k\]: n3
kdbaby14 [6k\]: I have a feeling that D-14 is a bad move
kdbaby14 [6k\]: for B
goren22 [2k\]: Garlock not so awfully horrible like in the other games.  but there is still time.
royu [4d\]: does anyone have link to chinese stream with kejie commentary?
robsclone: i still feel that alphaGo makes odd moves, that wouldn't work for anybody but a very strong close-fighter
adancassan [13k\]: Here it seems to be just the players and board (with some seconds of delay) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti04QT9M2Is
AnthonyC [3k\]: does that other guy even know how to play go?
bozboy204 [5k?\]: d14 seems like a normal continuation here, what are the risks to playing it?
cutcutcut: d14 might have similar issues as the variation redmond showed
easyrobot [2k\]: LSD is thinking like Fan Hui, teritory war is a good option so he fight hard from the beginning
bitzi [-\]: ke jie commentary (chinese): http://sports.letv.com/match/122343003.html?ref=index_focus_2#live/1020160303212747
SpicySpice [12k\]: D14 would be really dangerous if White took it though
Azal [2d\]: http://live.le.com/sports/play/index.shtml?type=zb&id=1020160303212747
GoIngo [?\]: move d15 looks normal for CrazyStone
rsun [-\]: chris is 3d
adfafdsfaf: Anthony, he is like amature 3d
royu [4d\]: thank you
drueknmstr [3d\]: pretty good theory robsclone
HeartXiao [3k\]: chris is 3d really??
oonicks: e13 suppsoedly has many follow up sequences most of them have b aim at cutting it
adfafdsfaf: AGA 3d
krater [10k\]: d14 d13 c15 c14 f14 b14 e15 but thats me
feeldabern [4d\]: 3d aga at least
HeartXiao [3k\]: in the first game he was really annoying 
AnthonyC [3k\]: why is he acting like he doesn't know the rules then :/
Syptryn [2d\]: hmmmm
oonicks: if lee knows what he is doing humans have not played this better
Trevoke [?\]: Can we PLEASE lay off of Chris Garlock?
robsclone: is Garlock the suit
HeartXiao [3k\]: is he purposely dumbing down his commentary?
goren22 [2k\]: why?  He's placed himself in that position himslef
rsun [-\]: he's taking care of the audience who doesn't know anything about go
Eternal6k [4k\]: Yes for beginners
Trevoke [?\]: He's trying to make more people interested in Go
robsclone: he's trying to involve people that have no idea what Go is
Wizardry [4d\]: surely b must d14
cutcutcut: yeah
]
;B[df]C[MrSparkle [22k?\]: Probably for the bennefit of people who are watching who are brand new to the game, only hearing about it because of the excitement aroudn this match
Eternal6k [4k\]: Peeps from AI field I guess
cutcutcut: letting w d14 would be.. ugh
adfafdsfaf: Today is the best commentary I have seen in the three games.  It is clearly improving.  AGA stream will be up in another 40 minutes or so.
superpal1 [1d\]: alphago seems weaker today
Trevoke [?\]: If you want to pay attention to something, pay attention to how Redmond keeps the commentary approachable and yet talks about deep, valuable principles.
miai [1d\]: redmond says e14 is not peaceful
Eternal6k [4k\]: Nice my move
ithisa [25k\]: yeah and the video is much better-made
ithisa [25k\]: no stupid camera cuts
robsclone: there are over 31k people watching the English stream - I'd guess more than a few thousand have no idea what they're watching
BigDoug [-\]: yes, excellent point Trevoke
kdbaby14 [6k\]: W may tenuki
leachy [2k\]: AI is a field like quantum computing is a field.....the name of something that doesn't exist
njs [1d\]: Redmond is a top notch commentator
robsclone: nice Trevoke
kdbaby14 [6k\]: I feel like B just need to enlongate
SpicySpice [12k\]: AI definitely exists
oonicks: redmond apparently would play a peacefull game against alphago?
Eternal6k [4k\]: Whatever
]
;W[ce]C[Eternal6k [4k\]: C15
Azal [2d\]: nobinobinobi
HeartXiao [3k\]: yeah garlock is definitely a lot less annoying, in the first game he kept trying to insert information of random japanese go terms that were vaguely relevant
drueknmstr [3d\]: the only way to play a peaceful game with alphago is to resign
Eternal6k [4k\]: Lee taking more time again
njs [1d\]: I feel like white is better here
cutcutcut: c15 not so good?
adfafdsfaf: it looks like white is better here.
cutcutcut: c16-d17 is strong
njs [1d\]: c14
oonicks: i dunno, proverb is: cut and cut again
goren22 [2k\]: i don't like w for the first time this tournament
robsclone: i agree, goren22
superpal1 [1d\]: e17
Sweetrip [9d\]: b16
robsclone: black is looking strong
adfafdsfaf: E17 is too big now.
Syptryn [2d\]: I like F17
Sweetrip [9d\]: cant see any other option for black
miai [1d\]: b16 weak
drueknmstr [3d\]: or maybe just pass the first two move, then alphago will play slack moves until it is ahead by one point
feeldabern [4d\]: e17 is the move from pro game
leachy [2k\]: can b f13 ?
robsclone: yeah i like F or E 17
goren22 [2k\]: f13?
Long [?\]: b b15
njs [1d\]: b16 is good
miai [1d\]: e17
ithisa [25k\]: this noob thinks e17 looks good too, otherwise the two stones look dead
njs [1d\]: Since black is facing for infoulence
njs [1d\]: influence*
HeartXiao [3k\]: f17 feels too many cutting points
aham [9k\]: c14
Tictactoe [-\]: ithisa, you have talent for this game ^^

;B[ec]C[ithisa [25k\]: i think i'm one of the rare people who naturally suck at this game ^^ learned go at least 10 years ago
miai [1d\]: e17...
njs [1d\]: c1 is terrible
adfafdsfaf: yea baby. E17
njs [1d\]: c14*
wikipwnia [3k\]: is myungwan commentating?
AnthonyC [3k\]: he should be later
feeldabern [4d\]: no
funhouse [2k\]: not yet
feeldabern [4d\]: he isn't period
royu [4d\]: not today
aham [9k\]: D15 is dead
HeartXiao [3k\]: c14 is squeezing hte toothpaste
DemonStyle [3d?\]: Cho Hyeyeon will be commenting on the AGA channel starting in 35 minutes
avon: cho hyeyeon will comment tonight
Azal [2d\]: ke jie thought e18
Trevoke [?\]: Myungwan is doing a live commentary in California tonight, he won't be on the AGA stream
goren22 [2k\]: c13?
Penfold [5k?\]: c1 *IS* terrible
goren22 [2k\]: or f16?
adfafdsfaf: watch alpha play F17. lol
tsukiatari [1d\]: they finally decided to put this demo in EGR, huh?
Burton [6k\]: with e 16 w created a target for b abd w will lose this game
]
;W[fd]C[cutcutcut: d14-e14 is broken shape for w, and b gets territory here.. so good for b so far?
Blitzbold [1d?\]: hm... mr redmonds tailor is blind?
adfafdsfaf: G17
feeldabern [4d\]: well b also has broken shape so...
jellyroll: g17
njs [1d\]: Lee is already losing
Azal [2d\]: G15
robsclone: no
watchingo: c14, force white to run
feeldabern [4d\]: if both have borken shape hard to say who is leading
robsclone: i like G15
glasszee [2k\]: w is so damn patient...
jellyroll: c14 bad... redmond just explained why...
robsclone: is he balsy enough?
SpicySpice [12k\]: E13 is looking better and better every turn
HeartXiao [3k\]: c14 is squeezing the toothpaste, low kyu move 
robsclone: right..
Long [?\]: this stuff is brrand new
js13 [1k\]: i don't get the way w play the game
hgfh: Lee thinks less and seems to be more assertive
superpal1 [1d\]: f13
njs [1d\]: c14 is bad , yep
goren22 [2k\]: ok, f14 has gotta be the right move
njs [1d\]: g17 maybe?
blau3: W will build a wall along h16,j15,...n15 and proceed to crush B in the center ;-)
danielhast [4k?\]: E13 doesn't seem that amazing
DarkRaist [3k\]: D13 possible or slow?
ithisa [25k\]: tenuki?
miai [1d\]: tenuki
MrSparkle [22k?\]: Blitzbold today I have to agree, although in the last two his suits have been pretty spot-on
glasszee [2k\]: i agree goren.
danielhast [4k?\]: seems like a reasonable way of playing lightly
BrentoBox [4k\]: C14 is gote
Rexxar [1k\]: dont lose hope guys
easyrobot [2k\]: D15 group look heavy
HeartXiao [3k\]: c14 is not gote lol
drueknmstr [3d\]: alphago made a bunch of mistakes both games, seems like it should be possible for lsd to be her
royu [4d\]: g15 ?
drueknmstr [3d\]: *beat
wikipwnia [3k\]: can b play f14?
danielhast [4k?\]: not that I could think of it, but Redmond didn't seem surprised by it
robsclone: g15 would be ballsy
miai [1d\]: I'd play a tenuki move around bottom right
ithisa [25k\]: druenknmstr: maybe alphago was playing mistakes because it was so sure it was winning
robsclone: i'd like that
qzx1198 [18k?\]: what is tenuki
leachy [2k\]: yes first i think f13 but maybe f14 is stronger
ithisa [25k\]: like i'd never play well if i'm playing against randombot
js13 [1k\]: still early though, think human will win this time
robsclone: alphaGo does know when its winning, and will make riskier moves if it thinks it is
ithisa [25k\]: qzx1198: play somewhere else on the board
Syptryn [2d\]: f13 ?
adfafdsfaf: f14 is slow and F17 for white is still big.
aham [9k\]: g17
ithisa [25k\]: robsclone: it's the opposite
oonicks: f16 in my eyes appears like teh first bottish move
Burton [6k\]: tenuki means to play ealsewhere
robsclone: he has to answer f16 ithisa
HeartXiao [3k\]: you''d allow white f17? pretty much breaks the moyo
ithisa [25k\]: it plays dumb conservative moves when it thinks its winning
Syptryn [2d\]: is F-17 sente?
adfafdsfaf: white will follow with F14
SpicySpice [12k\]: yeah why would it play risky moves when winning?
manta [3d\]: F17 feels natural but it feels slow to me
Sweetrip [9d\]: c13 
SpicySpice [12k\]: that makes no sense
MrSparkle [22k?\]: It plays high probability moves to win, it doesn't care how much it wins by
oldguy [4d\]: alphago is w?
sprouts [1d\]: I like f13
adfafdsfaf: alphago likes the center.
MrSparkle [22k?\]: AG is white, yes
kadoban [?\]: Anyone know if the AGA is doing a commentary again?
drueknmstr [3d\]: ithisa thats a common interpretation but im basing my remarks on gogameguru's analyses which described both games as swinging bac and forth between w and b leading numerous times
oldguy [4d\]: thx!
miai [1d\]: o3 maybe
bryamatt [11k\]: it plays dumb looking moves when it thinks it's winning, because it has calculated that they give it the highest probability of keeping the lead
easyrobot [2k\]: b can have a lot of teritory
Hikky [-\]: if AlphaGo wins game 3, do we get a game 4 and 5?
easyrobot [2k\]: just take it
adfafdsfaf: hikky yes
easyrobot [2k\]: yes
watchingo: yes
leachy [2k\]: it's that w would want f14
feeldabern [4d\]: all 5 games willl be played regardless
robsclone: where can we see gogameguru's analysis?
Bursar [1d\]: @Hikky, yes
Hikky [-\]: thanks adfafdsfaf
Syptryn [2d\]: II like f13 
Eternal6k [4k\]: F14?
easyrobot [2k\]: Fan Huil 5-0
HeartXiao [3k\]: according to the alphago analysis 
Hikky [-\]: and bursar
peakoil [1d\]: kibitz too fast
easyrobot [2k\]: still fight to the end
Sweetrip [9d\]: does anyone know if ke jie is commentating now?
iceweasel [-\]: d16 e15 f14?
Prodigious [-\]: yes
Bursar [1d\]: @peakoil agree
watchingo: sweetrip yes
Syptryn [2d\]: but is F-17 sente for white to kill corner?
wolvie [?\]: kibitz too strong
ithisa [25k\]: druenknmstr: I feel like especially in the first game lee lost early
Rexxar [1k\]: r7 and e13 are so good
HeartXiao [3k\]: last game it was about even in middle game but AG found itself more confident in its lead as it progressed
oonicks: it cuts with zero points for influence that is pretty cute
ithisa [25k\]: but don't trust my commentary loool
js13 [1k\]: b16
easyrobot [2k\]: can someone send me youtube link ?
jellyroll: b15 in sente? make b heavy?

kaji82 [3k\]: fight fight fight
adfafdsfaf: oh, wow.
miai [1d\]: if redmond is grandmaster what is lee sedol chris...
Tictactoe [-\]: redmond clearly states: being with a good fysical is needed in go
glasszee [2k\]: nice goren :) solid play
w1zzle [7k\]: Can alpha go blitz? Haha
drueknmstr [3d\]: ithisa yes lsd was behind early but had chances to come back several times according to ggg, and i believe was ahead for part of the game as well
adfafdsfaf: F17
HeartXiao [3k\]: super grandmaster
Sweetrip [9d\]: f14 is really awesome
Tictactoe [-\]: so don't sit behind the board all day: do your tai chi ^^
Sweetrip [9d\]: it looks like something alphago would play!
Azal [2d\]: f14 nice
Bursar [1d\]: F17
Bursar [1d\]: F17
aham [9k\]: ithisa said it
Azal [2d\]: solid

;W[fc]C[sprouts [1d\]: Any crazystone statistics?
adfafdsfaf: yea, I was right. :)
Hikky [-\]: it really does, doesn't it
ithisa [25k\]: lol japanese stream is still stuck in a variation that's many moves behind and completely different
aoyagi [2d\]: nice
aham [9k\]: 25k
momiji [3d\]: thx sweetrip
leachy [2k\]: also, it looks like something we basically all suggested
Falcon89 [5k\]: yepyep   sound body sound mind   TTT
wikipwnia [3k\]: f14 was my move :)
Eternal6k [4k\]: B15

;B[bd]C[Azal [2d\]: mmm but know w has h15
manta [3d\]: what does white play now?
jellyroll: w heavy
miai [1d\]: f14 just gave the game away, these are all what the machine wants moves
njs [1d\]: lee seems more calm
superpal1 [1d\]: lee seems to be happy with the game now
ToBeStrong [2k\]: b15 helps white eternal
manta [3d\]: h15 ?
Codexus [7k?\]: Lee Sedol looked satisfied by that move
aham [9k\]: f18
royu [4d\]: b16 necessary? 
royu [4d\]: or slow
glasszee [2k\]: well w certainly must respond...
manta [3d\]: maybe he doesnt want to give white forcing moves
njs [1d\]: Necessary..
GoIngo [?\]: just a new watermark: crazystone still at 47 % for black
ToBeStrong [2k\]: solid not slow
js13 [1k\]: if b b16 first maybe f17 and f14 miai for him, just my think
manta [3d\]: b16 b17 b14 for w would be nice if b doesnt play it
Bursar [1d\]: does alpha have the concept of ten-thousand-year ko?

;W[he]C[njs [1d\]: h15 is probably better

miai [1d\]: crazystone doesn't know anything
killrbunny [3k\]: Lee is trying to kill the whole thing!
Azal [2d\]: ass i said
leachy [2k\]: yes that's the real questionable move but i guess it makes moves like f17 not sente?
sprouts [1d\]: Thx golngo
cekalo [1k\]: oh man this game is gonna be intresting
glasszee [2k\]: i bet w knew exactly this would happen : /
Trevoke [?\]: I'm guessing ... g12 
SpicySpice [12k\]: can black cut somewhere in G?
SpicySpice [12k\]: or is that way too crazy
ithisa [25k\]: crazystone has nothing on alphago lol
w1zzle [7k\]: At a glance this looks very good for b... what is alpha go doing?
Eternal6k [4k\]: W already mapped out next two games
drueknmstr [3d\]: w does not know or think, just follows path of least energy
kdbaby14 [6k\]: alphago probably underestimate Lee Sedol
manta [3d\]: j15 h14 h16 ?
Tictactoe [-\]: redmond talks about the changes brought by shusaku
peakoil [1d\]: Remond giving good Go history now
oonicks: its a great move shoulder hit..
hgfh: Lee's probing is over. He'll give Alpha a hard time
miai [1d\]: d15 leads limited of variations, so you're right in a way @glass
HeartXiao [3k\]: dosaku, not shusaku

glasszee [2k\]: tfw h14 is a trap--we will look at this moment like "if only we knew..."
danielhast [4k?\]: h14 looks thin
katiuska [4d\]: Yeah I wonder what the chinese pros are saying http://live.le.com/sports/play/index.shtml?type=zb&id=1020160303212747
manta [3d\]: Maybe J14 ? 
katiuska [4d\]: particularly ke jie
HeartXiao [3k\]: cutcutcut, it's breaking up the potential black moyo
Rexxar [1k\]: he threatens to kill maybe, he will never be able to kill it
Sweetrip [9d\]: i have no doubt
miai [1d\]: if no h14 I quit go
ithisa [25k\]: chiense commentary sucks imo mostly due to their lack of any understanding of how alphago works
Sweetrip [9d\]: alphago already considers itself ahead by now
kdbaby14 [6k\]: it seems like AlphaGo is weaker than yesterday
Sweetrip [9d\]: because it evaluates positions by playing games against itself
danielhast [4k?\]: don't know what B will play, but I predict not h14
Sweetrip [9d\]: and it concludes if it played itself now, black would lose more often
glasszee [2k\]: sweetrip! good point! classic example of people saying "this seems slow"
Eternal6k [4k\]: And a database sweet
rsun [-\]: this game we'll see alphago's shinogi skills
js13 [1k\]: this is not usual play for alphago, comp litt bit surprise with E14 maybe
robsclone: i think it's really funny when the commontator talks about all these Go terms htat are very "human-centric"
manta [3d\]: im betting on j14 or j17 
fanweiqi [9d\]: The question is
deepblue [14k?\]: humans and their silly shapes
leachy [2k\]: i couldn't play this as white....i think it looks awful
fanweiqi [9d\]: is he More screwed now than at the beginning?
ithisa [25k\]: no
USSRMan [3d\]: white looks bad
Rexxar [1k\]: oh gawd please win this lee
Sweetrip [9d\]: black cannot let white live with 5-6 points
fanweiqi [9d\]: Please win!
USSRMan [3d\]: waiting for some terminator magic that somehow makes this opening good lol
Syptryn [2d\]: I do hope black wins...
Eternal6k [4k\]: B taking his time
bitzi [-\]: it seems the chinese pros prefer white here
Sweetrip [9d\]: thats too comfortable
GreenCoder [7k?\]: Sweetrip: One can still play the move one can thing is the best, while believing that he is behind.
ithisa [25k\]: i hope lee doesn't run out of time like last time
fanweiqi [9d\]: please survive so we can see its endgame
peakoil [1d\]: Go Sedol!
ithisa [25k\]: that suddenly ruined hisplaying
ausrussell [4k\]: yeah w does look bad to me... no territory or much inluence
gooooo [-\]: fan, please tell them to fix so alpha doesnt take the wrong corner in the first 4 moves!
Azal [2d\]: j14 aslo possible i guess
oonicks: mayb its the defining moment the difference between j17 and h14 is rather one of principle, i think it is scary
highhand [5k\]: b c18, give up e14 for now
HeartXiao [3k\]: link to chinese stream?
ithisa [25k\]: the remaining 3 corners look good for W to this noob though
drueknmstr [3d\]: we are on the early stages of computer go.  once we find out alphago's true strength we will see it beating 9p with 5 handis.
HeartXiao [3k\]: i want to see what ke jie is saying
glasszee [2k\]: greencoder, the theory people have is once bots are ahead, they start playing "slow" moves
Sweetrip [9d\]: no
goren22 [2k\]: fan is fanhui?
ithisa [25k\]: lol no
manta [3d\]: 5 handi to 9p is not really feasible
Sweetrip [9d\]: god himself would have a difficult time beating a 9p with 2 handi
feeldabern [4d\]: noone can give sedol 5 handi
HeartXiao [3k\]: 5 handi i don't think is possible
drueknmstr [3d\]: not this version but a future version
HeartXiao [3k\]: sweetrip, iono about that
ithisa [25k\]: even perfect play may be difficult
feeldabern [4d\]: not even perfect play can give sedol 5 handi
Rexxar [1k\]: haha i want to see ke jie ranting about how bad the players are while watching the game
kadoban [?\]: Isn't the estimate that top pros would take maybe 3 stones from god?
Sweetrip [9d\]: now, we can only guess at it because our feeble minds cannot wrap itself around a 19by19 oard
Syptryn [2d\]: white so much thought? I feel H14 is nature...
Chubi [-\]: r u sure guys ?
Sweetrip [9d\]: for example
danielhast [4k?\]: I bet top pros are no more than 4 stones from perfect play
HeartXiao [3k\]: 3 or 4 handi maybe 
USSRMan [3d\]: how many stones is lee sedol away from perfect play?
HeartXiao [3k\]: 2 handi i bet god could win 
Sweetrip [9d\]: would you ask if god can give a 9p 2 handi on 9 by 9
Sweetrip [9d\]: no?
HeartXiao [3k\]: no ofc not
Sweetrip [9d\]: 11 by 11?
feeldabern [4d\]: probably not
Sweetrip [9d\]: 13 by 13?
USSRMan [3d\]: can god give lee sedol 2 stones?
feeldabern [4d\]: maybe
Sweetrip [9d\]: impossible on 13 by 13
iceweasel [-\]: if this were the first game, most ppl would give up on w. but now we suspect w to have hidden resources
BigDoug [-\]: please keep the comments about the game, not about God or philosophy
HeartXiao [3k\]: 2 handi on 9x9 is equivalent to like 4 handi on 19x19
glasszee [2k\]: god's answer: kill opponent 
fengitreon [2k\]: any links to the AGA live channel?
momiji [3d\]: go seigen said god would always win by .5
Sweetrip [9d\]: we can feel very confident about that
K5 [5k?\]: All fairly speculative, but I heard God ~13d
BigDoug [-\]: please keep the comments about the game, not about God or philosophy
Cilien [-\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s
goren22 [2k\]: a perfect player can probably give 4h to anyone else
GreenCoder [7k?\]: glasszee: I would believe you only if alphago plays A1.
escudero [3k\]: redmond showed nice variation why not h14
hgfh: lol
Rexxar [1k\]: his next move is so important
Sweetrip [9d\]: 19by19, im afraid most kgs players cannot understand why a top pro cannot lose to god on 2 stones
zari [3k\]: danielahst.  I know a 3p reasonably well,  and he said there is no player on earth who could defeat him if he had 3 stones,  and maybe less than ten who could do it if he had 2
goren22 [2k\]: on 9x9
glasszee [2k\]: ahaha that would be the ultimate insult. woud be a nice "easter egg" for deepmind to implement
Eternal6k [4k\]: Ext down
HeartXiao [3k\]: stockfish can beat a supergm with black and a pawn handicap
leachy [2k\]: maybe there is some idea of b h14 j17 k17 j14 h13 k16 k15 l16 l17 m16 h17 j18 h18 f18

Bursar [1d\]: J17
Azal [2d\]: dunno about j17

Sweetrip [9d\]: by god, i mean a perfect go player
Bursar [1d\]: ~~~~~ host J17 ~~~~

;B[ic]C[Trevoke [?\]: B played J17
Sweetrip [9d\]: no offense to those who are religious
Trevoke [?\]: Bursar: take a breath
Eternal6k [4k\]: H14?
oonicks: btw this appears to be leading to lee making a similarly pointless incasion on the bottom
adfafdsfaf: I didn't even haave to think about it and I said J17 :)
Eternal6k [4k\]: Jump
]
;W[hg]C[miai [1d\]: since there is no god, a pointless discuss
HeartXiao [3k\]: no one is talking about god, just "perfect play"
Chubi [-\]: why dont b play in bottom ?
Azal [2d\]: this seems bad for b
ithisa [25k\]: i find it extremely infuriating that the numbering on the board in the stream is all screwed
danielhast [4k?\]: B taking his time, I hope time pressure isn't such a problem this game
goren22 [2k\]: I see g13 for b, or am I crazy?
Eternal6k [4k\]: Big b wall
kadoban [?\]: Yeah it's a bit annoying that there isn't a consistent coordinate system
Nam [-\]: j14?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: B plays J-14
aoyagi [2d\]: mm...
feeldabern [4d\]: yes 1 - 19 backwards and they have a letter I T.T
adfafdsfaf: G13?
oonicks: well there is a proverb for it:) but i forgot, you should not leave situations unsettled
GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone opinion: black at 44 %  now

DarkRaist [3k\]: This feels good for black?
Trevoke [?\]: And it looks like d14 might be in danger.
rsun [-\]: they can feel each other

;W[gg]C[ToLesto [13k?\]: heartxiao, crazystone is stronger then you
goren22 [2k\]: now w g13 and b gotta q14 or something
miai [1d\]: I beat all 9ps giving them 360 stones
GoIngo [?\]: yes they are brothers in their genes
fanweiqi [9d\]: no its much worse for B than if w played h14 and b got h16
Sweetrip [9d\]: c12
Rexxar [1k\]: of course crazystone favors his own race, not suprising...
ithisa [25k\]: sure, me and lee sedol are both humans, we can feel each other. i can totally commentary his game
leachy [2k\]: b feels overconcentrated on the top right
HeartXiao [3k\]: sure, my opinion is worthless as well
Weirdsel [4k?\]: Q14 ftw ;)
USSRMan [3d\]: that is surprising for me
azblueeyes [8k\]:  B keeping sente better tonight...it feels like
glasszee [2k\]: leachy, talk about overconcentrated, how about w top left?
swampthing [2d\]: is there no aga commentary for this one?
TitanPupil [2d\]: is crazystone ai though
rsun [-\]: must push
Trevoke [?\]: Is it worth sacrificing d14 if W ends up overconcentrated
cjb: Q14's not ambitious enough, I think?
cjb: Q12
TitanPupil [2d\]: michaelredmond is giving commentary, swamp
njs [1d\]: is f13 slow?
aoyagi [2d\]: I think it is good
aoyagi [2d\]: .
Penfold [5k?\]: SE saysAlphaGo +88
kadoban [?\]: swampthing: There will be a AGA commentary, starting in 20 minutes or so I think
leachy [2k\]: true glasszee
a1328 [3k\]: nearly 500 ppl
TitanPupil [2d\]: SE is pronounced sai
gooooo [-\]: lee using a lot of time
HeartXiao [3k\]: kim myungwan isn't commenting for AGA today
qzx1198 [18k?\]: what is meant by slow?
GoIngo [?\]: crazystone is commercial bot
kdbaby14 [6k\]: SAI = smart artifical intelligent
swampthing [2d\]: oh. okay, thanks heartxiao
gooooo [-\]: hope he won't be getting time problems
rsun [-\]: slow, opposite of fast
BlueDeck [2d\]: white overconcentrated ? What is this supposed to mean ?
kadoban [?\]: cho hye-hyun for AGA today
oonicks: slow you may have to add many moves
glasszee [2k\]: qzx--speed is measured not in m/s but in points per move.
K5 [5k?\]: D14 looks too big to let go easily imo
HeartXiao [3k\]: there will be commentary in 20 min by cho hyehyun 
aham [9k\]: c12 is fine
swampthing [2d\]: oh cool
Sweetrip [9d\]: c12, then k12
Nam [-\]: i think Lee need big time for play with alphago :)
deadflower [1k\]: tenuki now?
azblueeyes [8k\]: qzx...slow=less tham suberbly efficient...not a dual purpose move
glasszee [2k\]: i agree deadflower.
ruby [2d\]: Zen claims 44% for b
goren22 [2k\]: q14 or even q13
rsun [-\]: alpha just erased the framework effortlessly
GoIngo [?\]: thx ruby
Syptryn [2d\]: d13 
aham [9k\]: ok sweetrip
drueknmstr [3d\]: all mc agree
rsun [-\]: without doing anything special
njs [1d\]: ^
GoIngo [?\]: yes, all brothers >-)
goren22 [2k\]: and just maybe k12
royu [4d\]: does 44% for b necessarily mean 56% for w? serious question
glasszee [2k\]: will b move on the right side or the bottom side?
GoIngo [?\]: yes
Eternal6k [4k\]: Can b sacrifice 3 stones?
GoIngo [?\]: but it does not mean 44 % winning chances
BlueDeck [2d\]: again, the action takes place in b's sphere. It's amazing how in each game nothing happens in AlphaGo's sphere of influence, as if Lee didn't take it into account
aham [9k\]: may be he think tenuki
Tictactoe [-\]: sedol used half an hour now
kadoban [?\]: Yeah those 3 stones don't seem too important right now
royu [4d\]: cool, ty

;B[jh]C[fengitreon [2k\]: is Myungwan Kim broadcasting?
USGO1 [-\]: Thank you so much TTT for the great job with the mirror!
njs [1d\]: white giving up all these stones
Rexxar [1k\]: moyo!!!
glasszee [2k\]: hm..... k12 is bordering on not sente
USGO1 [-\]: We'll be broadcasting with Cho Hyeyeon 9p starting in fifteen minutes
oonicks: we should get stuck at some point like this and decide sth like j14 is too slow, if aphago wins that is
Eternal6k [4k\]: E12
Syptryn [2d\]: I like this move...
qzx1198 [18k?\]: what is moyo
njs [1d\]: moyo is influence
HeartXiao [3k\]: kim is commenting at a live event
Tictactoe [-\]: i hope my cat won't disturb the relay, it tookup interest for this game
ithisa [25k\]: potential territory
HeartXiao [3k\]: moyo is territorial framework
K5 [5k?\]: royu yes, I think it is a winning probability
Rexxar [1k\]: moyo might be AGs weakness
Trevoke [?\]: k12 will go down in history as the processor-reddening move
K5 [5k?\]: and we can assume jigo/chosei has 0%
miai [1d\]: listen to redmond he is better
Sweetrip [9d\]: yesterday's 5th line shoulder hit
Sweetrip [9d\]: was truly an ear reddeningmove
Chubi [-\]: omg
rsun [-\]: reverse shoulder hit!
glasszee [2k\]: qzx, moyo is like connecting the dots of 1 color to form a big fence
royu [4d\]: oh man... this next move...
cjb: whaaa
peakoil [1d\]: Redmond commentary good for 1d like me
Chubi [-\]: omg
HeartXiao [3k\]: the shoulder hit yesterday was... crazy
goren22 [2k\]: d11
kadoban [?\]: Redmond is a nice commentator, but he has to spend a lot of time explaining things to non-players and beginners.
]
;W[ci]C[Eternal6k [4k\]: Wow
peakoil [1d\]: ack!
oonicks: somewhere there..
Penfold [5k?\]: playing for influence seems sensible given last 2 games
Trevoke [?\]: This had to be coming
a1328 [3k\]: wow
w1zzle [7k\]: That looked important for w
colombia2 [1k\]: (*´艸`*)
miai [1d\]: you can't call everything an ear reddening move, no offense
Tictactoe [-\]: elephants move
glasszee [2k\]: w knows the elephant jump
royu [4d\]: c11 is the gg move 
js13 [1k\]: who plays toward center first, will win the game, go lee
ruby [2d\]: 哇
Sweetrip [9d\]: lee sedol has NO CHANCE
rsun [-\]: this is technically called the "elelphant reverse shoulder hit"
Jermelle [?\]: ^
Le0na99 [5k\]: C11 great
Jermelle [?\]: Sadly, Lee has no chance.
DarkRaist [3k\]: Jesus how do you see a move like C11
Trevoke [?\]: miai: Well, I was joking. I'd agree with Sweetrip though.
kadoban [?\]: C11 is surprising
HeartXiao [3k\]: seriously, the shoulder hit yesterday was insane
Syptryn [2d\]: damn
DarkRaist [3k\]: this is not reasonable
Syptryn [2d\]: C11 is strong
ithisa [25k\]: redmond saw c11 i think
azblueeyes [8k\]: lol  rsun
HeartXiao [3k\]: this move also looks/// so strong
glasszee [2k\]: alphago have confirmed that this re-application of the elephant jump was from a notorious KGS sandbagger
swampthing [2d\]: the kneecap hit
aham [9k\]: c12 have said sweetrip
USSRMan [3d\]: this is unreal
ixido [8k\]: did sweetrip's kid brother hack his account?
HeartXiao [3k\]: white's moves feel so strong 
aham [9k\]: d13 is lost
kdbaby14 [6k\]: Lee use too much time already
glasszee [2k\]: "lee sedol has no chance" is something that pretty much 0% of the population believed just 3 days ago, keep in mind
njs [1d\]: How did white do this
a1328 [3k\]: hello sweetrip@
glasszee [2k\]: it relaly is an absurd statement
w1zzle [7k\]: Until now I thought it looked like b was kickin w ass but now not at all
oonicks: now have to sacrifice i think tunrned into have to sacrifice with sacrifice
USSRMan [3d\]: pulling e14 out seems so heavy
glasszee [2k\]: (true as it is)
HeartXiao [3k\]: yeah after yesterday, people think lee sedol has very little chance
Sweetrip [9d\]: i am judging simply by the caliber of the moves
Sweetrip [9d\]: alphago's play is consistently perfect
LATE [1k\]: lol what is c11
HeartXiao [3k\]: even lee yesterday says he is just trying to win one game now
Slug [1k\]: to be fair, nobody knew alphago
royu [4d\]: should have played tengen
royu [4d\]: ;)
HeartXiao [3k\]: and lee played a strong game yesterday, it's hard to say where he went wrong
cutcutcut: darkreist: you see these kinds of things by thinking of an ordinary move you'd make and then looking for other positions nearby to try to hit a weak spot
HeartXiao [3k\]: or 2 days ago
swampthing [2d\]: when was the last time alphago lost to a human?
oonicks: smiles here:)
Ahamay [7d?\]: does anyone have a ke jie stream link?
rsun [-\]: I have a sinister feeling that b cannot afford komi
ixido [8k\]: well, you're the 9d. so I listen to what you say, but tone is a bit hard?
Rexxar [1k\]: aww man thats very frustrating to heat from a 9d...
cjb: alphago lost some informal games to fan hui
ithisa [25k\]: swampthing: it has lost many times in google testing
js13 [1k\]: c10 b15
cjb: but has never lost a formal game
qzx1198 [18k?\]: what is komi
lurrch [?\]: He lost to fan hui in blitz
Eternal6k [4k\]: D11- cut?
glasszee [2k\]: heartxiao, i remember kim was having trouble finding more than 1 mistake for Lee and still lost! i found that significant
ithisa [25k\]: but it constantly improves itself
Anatoly [2d?\]: does anyone have the link to the unlisted YouTube stream which shows Lee Sedol and the board the whole time?
buhaypa [3k\]: 7.5
ToBeStrong [2k\]: Lee has already won this game
kadoban [?\]: The blitz games were with less hardware too, weren't they?
GoIngo [?\]: they played DFan Hui day fo day
GoIngo [?\]: for 5 months

katiuska [4d\]: ahamay: http://live.le.com/sports/play/index.shtml?type=zb&id=1020160303212747
miai [1d\]: the bot made mistakes, just watch the two games again on youtube,9p finds mistakes but an amateur 9d says no it's perfect...
USSRMan [3d\]: google should let us look at alphago's internal estimate of its probability of winning
rustychow [5k\]: how did alphago come up with the 5th line shoulder hit yesterday? 
GoIngo [?\]: likely they will after the match
ithisa [25k\]: that would probably give the game away too soon though, especially for noob journalists at the event
HeartXiao [3k\]: do we really know if they are real mistakes though, miai?
drueknmstr [3d\]: rustychow they say it was randomly selected from all its moves.  actually 1/10000 chance of choosing that move
HeartXiao [3k\]: or simply concessions to reduce margin of victory but increase probability?
LATE [1k\]: there are no mistakes, only ugly moves.
glasszee [2k\]: tfw it's 100% after every move. then we know the robot has human levels of hubris. how the tables have turned!
iambad [2d?\]: c11 looks nice
miai [1d\]: shoulder hit was an ordinary move
adfafdsfaf: We don't know if they are "mistakes" they are just not moves humans would normally play.
LATE [1k\]: c11 looks like a 5k move, but suddenly it becomes a 9p move because it's an output from a computer.
Ahamay [7d?\]: thx katiuska
ithisa [25k\]: yeah, for alphago a choice between a move that gets it 40 points and a move that gets it 1 point, if both have the same win rate, is basically miai
gomathgo [1k\]: link to andrew jackson stream?
cjb: katiuska: who is commenting there?
HeartXiao [3k\]: how is c11 a 5k move?
peakoil [1d\]: Is AlphaGo software open source?
m09 [-\]: no
glasszee [2k\]: the 5th line shoulder hit was a "1/10,000 chance for human to play it." alphago looked at it anyway, and bot senses overrided human.
danielhast [4k?\]: B tenuki Q10 or Q11? or would that be ridiculous?
cjb: no, peakoil
HeartXiao [3k\]: no
ithisa [25k\]: peakoil: no, but the ideas behind it are openly documented in the paper
kadoban [?\]: peakoil: No. There is an academic paper on how it was built and such though.
LATE [1k\]: k12 wasn't efficient either
katiuska [4d\]: Ahamay: maybe you can tell us the chinese thoughts on the game so far
goren22 [2k\]: ok, b gotta sack the 3 right now.  q13 instead
Sweetrip [9d\]: alphago no longer relies on its database of pro games
peakoil [1d\]: IS there a link to the paper?
ithisa [25k\]: it shouldn't be hard to make another alphago given the paper, given you have the powerful machines of course
Slug [1k\]: it looks like it an be cut, and it can, but at a big cost
buhaypa [3k\]: I think there's no Myungwan Kim commentary online today
drueknmstr [3d\]: someone put up an open source version of alphago on github, i believe earlier today: https://github.com/Rochester-NRT/AlphaGo
ithisa [25k\]: Sweetrip: alphago doesn't have a pro game database
ithisa [25k\]: its initial database was KGS games, lol
ithisa [25k\]: read the paper
Sweetrip [9d\]: so whether or not out of 10000 games in its database, only 1 game contains the shoulder hit is not relavant
AutoAtari [2k?\]: elephant jump usually looks like a strong move
GoIngo [?\]: kim retired after thursday
zampa [-\]: buhaypa really? :(
Sweetrip [9d\]: kgs games, same thing
miai [1d\]: there is no invincible go player, keep this in mind
drueknmstr [3d\]: not that actual alphago source though, just based off the same paper
cjb: drueknmstr: they haven't actually written any code yet
cjb: (I took a look)
Tictactoe [-\]: redmond mentions Oeda to be his mentor
Sweetrip [9d\]: the point is, alphago relies on pure calculation now
cjb: it's not an implementation of the paper by any means
wikipwnia [3k\]: Lee rocking back and forth looks like he is comforting himself
Eternal6k [4k\]: Come in Lee let last games time issues be a lesson
alobar [9k\]: alphago learned shoulder bump from alobar 10k
HeartXiao [3k\]: alphago does not rely on pure calculation
drueknmstr [3d\]: oh yeah guess youre right cjb
]
;B[dg]C[HeartXiao [3k\]: you have very poor understanding of how neural nets work 
njs [1d\]: LEe is trolling now
easyrobot [2k\]: of course Alpha go has a pro database, you think google is fool ?
Chubi [-\]: report afk
uberaji [?\]: where ya goin sedol
Blitzbold [1d?\]: lee just escaped
Trevoke [?\]: Something something "tonight we dine in hell"
ithisa [25k\]: HeartXiao: I suppose he counts neural networks as computation
rsun [-\]: ajahuang is the real stone buddha
Azal [2d\]: d13 seems odd again
wikipwnia [3k\]: @blitzbold lol
miai [1d\]: kgs games is not same thing with pro games, sweetrip
adfafdsfaf: D11
USSRMan [3d\]: he left the building
ithisa [25k\]: it's definitely more computation-like than joseki dictionaries and such
rsun [-\]: he has shown 0 facial expression since game 1
rustychow [5k\]: alphago couldn't have found that 5th line shoulder hit from its database
LATE [1k\]: the point here is not to escape, but to make k12 effective, guys
GoIngo [?\]: ajahunag is a lovely guy
Sweetrip [9d\]: i thought the neural network is responsible for minimizing the set of moves to consider
rustychow [5k\]: unless it looked at lots of amateur games
HeartXiao [3k\]: by that definition, anything a computer does is computation
bert [?\]: lee sedol went to the toilet to consult some other bot?
drueknmstr [3d\]: not a database, has learned generalizations of patterns/shapes from actual games though
]
;W[di]C[Rephos [23k\]: d11
ausrussell [4k\]: is Lee allowed to check his computer?
Sweetrip [9d\]: or maybe i confused it with something else
glasszee [2k\]: right--sweetrip, the "policy network" which tries to predict human likelihod
RoadHobo [6k\]: Lee Sedol got up and left the room after that move, not seeming very confident about it
HeartXiao [3k\]: no, you are thinking of the monte carlo algorithms
USSRMan [3d\]: black lost so badly!
ithisa [25k\]: HeartXiao: the neural net is used to optimize the monte carlo, the monte carlo is the core algorithm
Eternal6k [4k\]: 2 stones on left getting weaker
Codexus [7k?\]: No other bot than alphago would be useful
USSRMan [3d\]: this position clearly favors white
peakoil [1d\]: George Bush used a tiny earpiece when he gave speeches. Maybe Lee Sedol has help too?
drueknmstr [3d\]: policy network chooses likely moves from pattern matching
adfafdsfaf: I think D13 was terrible
AutoAtari [2k?\]: when Redmond says "tsumego" it sounds like "Smeagol"
HeartXiao [3k\]: the neural nets use pattern matching 
ithisa [25k\]: alphago vs the entire hankuk kiwon
liptos [3k\]: time to consult igowin
GoIngo [?\]: cs did not like d13
js13 [1k\]: ah still confuse with b f14
royu [4d\]: autoatari, maybe that is what he meant to say, that to get better, he studies smeagol
USSRMan [3d\]: what is current reading golngo
Azal [2d\]: d13 too bad i think
momiji [3d\]: d13 either terrible or brilliant...?
glasszee [2k\]: i'm glad im not the only one who heard that
HeartXiao [3k\]: this feels really heavy for black
njs [1d\]: Lee left the seat, his ears were red
Syptryn [2d\]: This is looking bad...
Syptryn [2d\]: for black
Slug [1k\]: Where can I see him?
Tictactoe [-\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUAmTYHEyM8
alobar [9k\]: worse than first game
alobar [9k\]: his confidence is shot.
miai [1d\]: you just find Lee Sedol move heavy? Lee Lee?
frozensoul [-\]: actually, baduk tv is having trouble finding a damaging result for black
wikipwnia [3k\]: the way white stays connected
Azal [2d\]: gg
USSRMan [3d\]: letting white d11 is sooooo painful!

frozensoul [-\]: not painful

frozensoul [-\]: watch baduk tv
easyrobot [2k\]: they are talking about SAI
frozensoul [-\]: if black hanes
kdbaby14 [6k\]: Lee went outside
js13 [1k\]: b play like following what w want start from w f16
frozensoul [-\]: they havent found a bad result yet lol
oonicks: mayb should have been e12, this is why i think computers will beat us at go
Canarmane [-\]: is it just me or is W's shape in the top left 'weird'? Not bad, obviously, but it just looks weird to my eyes
katiuska [4d\]: b win connect but w whill cut off c6&d10 stones
escudero [3k\]: I think its playable for both sides
katiuska [4d\]: will connect*
Eternal6k [4k\]: This seems like aji keshi
cekalo [1k\]: alphago is drinking water?
Canarmane [-\]: alphago needs to empty its cache

USSRMan [3d\]: doesnt need anything\]
drueknmstr [3d\]: i feel sorry for lsd taking all these breaks, is this common in pro games?
Eternal6k [4k\]: B*
LouisXIII [1k\]: electricity maybe
MrSparkle [22k?\]: Eh, he needs like 6000 W
MrSparkle [22k?\]: that's a lot
kadoban [?\]: Probably more than that
killrbunny [3k\]: is αGo in the cloud? that would explain why it is so much stronger
Rexxar [1k\]: the chinese stream with ke jie looks much more fun, pity that i dont understand chinese :(
drueknmstr [3d\]: yes killrbunny it uses google compute platform
peakoil [1d\]: BigDoug is funny
miai [1d\]: aja huang has to play what the computer says
RoadHobo [6k\]: I wonder what the carbon footprint of Alphago is.  How much is it contributing to climate change?
rustychow [5k\]: wait how do I watch the chinese stream?
AnthonyC [3k\]: which browser did you use to open ke jie stream?
njs [1d\]: Alphago's games are those in which each move seems normal, but after like 30 moves, you look at the whole picture and are like "damn, how did he get this much territory etc?"
jytsao [?\]: frankly, i doubt alphago cares
AnthonyC [3k\]: i kept getting error
liptos [3k\]: but next we will use alphago to solve climate change
buhaypa [3k\]: Chris Garlock needs to just be quiet and let Redmond analyze the game
killrbunny [3k\]: the aga stream is starting soon?
kadoban [?\]: Should be soon, yeah.
miai [1d\]: he is back
liptos [3k\]: or alpha go will become skynet and ruin the climate
Canarmane [-\]: @njs I kind of feel that way. I am looking at the shape in the top left and I feel like no regular player would make a shape like that
gomathgo [1k\]: what can b even play in this situation?
jytsao [?\]: michael redmond is commenting on game on the youtube stream already isn't he?
a1328 [3k\]: almost 600  ppl
miai [1d\]: e11
jytsao [?\]: what's special about the AGA stream?
Heraclitus: i thuought no AGAstream this time
peakoil [1d\]: AlphaGo is part of larger AI learning that Google is funding. Some of it is scary.
cutcutcut: buhay: chris is a lot more quiet this time, not so annoying..
miai [1d\]: played
Canarmane [-\]: Redmond is definitely live right now
kdbaby14 [6k\]: hane here?
Trevoke [?\]: B e11 
jellyroll: b now looking  like he must  give up  the 4 stones, AND is looking ththin on olwer left
killrbunny [3k\]: but there will be a real analysus on the aga stream
frozensoul [-\]: oh look the hane
weaknoob: AlphaGo is running on >1200 processors and 170+ gpus, yes?
frozensoul [-\]: like i said
frozensoul [-\]: lel
glasszee [2k\]: frozensoul: very impressive read
drueknmstr [3d\]: yes jytsao
Rexxar [1k\]: http://live.le.com/sports/play/index.shtml?type=zb&id=1020160303212747
adfafdsfaf: E11 was played
kadoban [?\]: The AGA stream focuses more on deep analysis. Redmond has to make it interesting for non-players.
buhaypa [3k\]: Theres no aga stream
narugo [1d\]: e11 maybe hehe
drueknmstr [3d\]: jytsao sorry in deepmind stream
adfafdsfaf: w will E12
MrSparkle [22k?\]: weaknoob: yes
Eternal6k [4k\]: Hane
hgfh: not a good sign for Lee
MrSparkle [22k?\]: based on the paper
frozensoul [-\]: its confirmed frozensoul 9p
frozensoul [-\]: top lel
glasszee [2k\]: i was like no that looks terri--oh wait, that's pretty briliiant
jytsao [?\]: go fro fro
Canarmane [-\]: why hane?
adfafdsfaf: E10 maybe
miai [1d\]: b13
MrSparkle [22k?\]: who knows how that has changed since the match vs. Fan Hui though
]
;B[ei]
;W[bg]C[killrbunny [3k\]: do we *know* how many processors αGo is using?
playerx [2d\]: strange idea to start review on AGA stream 1h after game started, little bit lazy isnt it ?
jlw2 [21k?\]: Redmond should probably get a tailor for a better fitting suit.
hgfh: C6 D10 hurt
killrbunny [3k\]: No, they can go faster!
ithisa [25k\]: yeah his suit sucks
Tictactoe [-\]: yes the amount of hardware is known
coral314 [2k?\]: おおこれか
AnthonyC [3k\]: i finally got ke jie stream to work from here http://sports.letv.com/video/24850263.html
coral314 [2k?\]: はじまったばっかだな
jytsao [?\]: i sort of feel time pressures work against humans
fdasdsfa: we know how many they used against fan hui
miai [1d\]: redmond finds the situation dangerous for white
KoyoToya [-\]: Who is b
escudero [3k\]: I like black
jytsao [?\]: LSD
jytsao [?\]: *lee sedol
fdasdsfa: but not how many they are using now
Sweetrip [9d\]: they should seriously
Azal [2d\]: what says cs?
drueknmstr [3d\]: killrbunny we know the number used according to deepmind's paper on alphago
USSRMan [3d\]: crazystone reading?
coral314 [2k?\]: 白ぽいけどどっちだ
Tictactoe [-\]: they use the same now like in the fan hui games
Sweetrip [9d\]: feed alphago the hardest problem ever
Trevoke [?\]: jytsao : AlphaGo lost blitz games against Fan Hui - so extreme time pressures work against the bot
weaknoob: 1920 CPUs and 280 GPUs total for these 5 matches
GoIngo [?\]: cs 42 % for black now
miai [1d\]: does aliens play go?
adfafdsfaf: Time: Alpha 1:40, Lee 1:16
SpicySpice [12k\]: what is blitz in this context?
jytsao [?\]: SE favors b
SpicySpice [12k\]: 5 minutes, 15 minutes?
kadoban [?\]: Sweetrip: Yeah I was wondering yesterday what it'd make of igohatsuyoron. I can't find anywhere info on if they have fed it go problems or not ... I would assume yes, but ...
jytsao [?\]: can we update SE with a-go programing?
ithisa [25k\]: coral314: 日本語ストリームはここにありますね：https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZtZdAaInEM
azblueeyes [8k\]: c14 b14 b15so that is not the purpose of  b13 
USSRMan [3d\]: so a strong mc bot already thinks white is favorable
GoIngo [?\]: cs: expected score 12.5 +-16 for white
glasszee [2k\]: there's just so many fun things to do with alphago... i hope they publish at least a few
weaknoob:  fan hui has went from over 600 ranked in the world to in the top 300 since October after playing AlphaGo over the months helping train AlphaGo up
azblueeyes [8k\]: w aiming at b8 
highhand [5k\]: anyone got link for analysis of game 2?
ArcticDawn [6k\]: i really hope Lee can make the computer go crazy and start playing struggling moves.
jytsao [?\]: is that how a-go programming works?
PaleFire [18k?\]: I'm looking for LeeSedol to gather is inner Thecaptain and fight all over the board
Rexxar [1k\]: screw bots estimation, they all cheer for alphago
miai [1d\]: b12
]
;B[bh]C[GoIngo [?\]: maybe, maybe not
royu [4d\]: not bad for b?
jytsao [?\]: i get the feeling that a-go doens't really follow a plan, just calculatesboard position constantly to figure out what's best
cekalo [1k\]: omg this game is intense
anton007 [-\]: seems good for b
Ml9799 [?\]: who is playing? 
gooooo [-\]: ... "Mandatory Windows updates delay commentary. Jokes write themselves... Cho Hyeyeon 9p commentary will be up soon!"
SpicySpice [12k\]: right but if things go according to how it calculated the turn before
Trevoke [?\]: AGA stream still not up?
Tictactoe [-\]: please cheer for sedol, let him be the last to defeat this hellsly machine
SpicySpice [12k\]: thats following a plan for all purposes
peakoil [1d\]: I hope Lee wins.
drueknmstr [3d\]: highland some game 2 commentary here: https://gogameguru.com/alphago-races-ahead-2-0-lee-sedol/
voevius [5k\]: a human win is a no go whenever alpha go plays slow.
Azal [2d\]: b12 nice
Azal [2d\]: going for the cut
Chesired [1d\]: is this game 2 or 3?
TARAHUMARA [8k\]: Lee can do it! Next one wll be Ke Jie according to AlphaGo 
voevius [5k\]: game 3
drueknmstr [3d\]: game 3
TARAHUMARA [8k\]: 3rd
glasszee [2k\]: i have an idea: every 1000 dollars viewers donate to cancer research, deepmind shuts off one CPU from alphago's processing
alobar [9k\]: slow play is bad play. what is alpha doing
killrbunny [3k\]: looks like Lee is gonna kill the whole thing?
njs [1d\]: glasszee what a good idea
Canarmane [-\]: lol
Tictactoe [-\]: twiddling thumbs is the way to stimulate the brain
ithisa [25k\]: haha
njs [1d\]: however, money for cancer research is not a good use of money as opposed to numerous other things
Eternal6k [4k\]: B15
wikipwnia [3k\]: why is lee's clock ticking?
Tictactoe [-\]: talking about cho chikun now, and his usage of fan and matches
ithisa [25k\]: yeah wtf

DarkRaist [3k\]: good outcome?
cjb: any AGA stream?
BLikeWater [3d\]: moyo game will result in favor on human player
GoIngo [?\]: still 43 % for black
GoIngo [?\]: says cs
alobar [9k\]: is alpha able to throw a game to protect his rank?
Azal [2d\]: well 1% increase
Slug [1k\]: lee is not okay in this situation
]
;W[cj]C[rsun [-\]: 43% is pretty bad winrate for cs

wikipwnia [3k\]: the whole f17 group is still weak
njs [1d\]: If black doesn't kill this, isn't black screwed?
royu [4d\]: the line Cho Hyeyeon just showed seems very favorable for W
kdbaby14 [6k\]: black does not need to kill I think
kdbaby14 [6k\]: just chase and take territory?
DarkRaist [3k\]: Alphago is teaching us how to play go right. Play like a 5k. Invade your opponent's moyo, they won't be able to kill you, escape and win

USSRMan [3d\]: i dont like redmonds commentary because he tells me stuff i already know
Syptryn [2d\]: f12 
Azal [2d\]: e9
blau3: or F13
Syptryn [2d\]: ?
killrbunny [3k\]: You can learn how to teach from him!
Trevoke [?\]: Both Hyeyeon and Redmond mentioned g11 as the upcoming move, so ... You know, at least AlphaGo's not doing something *crazy*.
Azal [2d\]: must e9
alobar [9k\]: and he tells us stuff lee does not know
Penfold [5k?\]: redmond is talking to a mass audience
drueknmstr [3d\]: alphago is just too good, poor lsd playing against this position
SpicySpice [12k\]: if white takes E12 where can blacks snake make life?
Eternal6k [4k\]: Redmond awesome commentator
SpicySpice [12k\]: it doesnt look good for any race
alobar [9k\]: western technology deserves western commentator
Canarmane [-\]: doesnt B have to run towards left now?
matiej [7k\]: Redmond is cool, but the other guy kinda lacks any knowledge, so he is just disturbing. :(
shinigami [2d?\]: black not doing so well already :(((((
USSRMan [3d\]: thats racist

USSRMan [3d\]: e12 gives half an eye

suicao [3d\]: i like Lee
SpicySpice [12k\]: yeah white cant take E12 now
feeldabern [4d\]: but whether it is better than f13
jytsao [?\]: i believe someone commented earlier that AGA stream is already up
nretnal [5k\]: if alpha go wins, will they play games 4/5?
feeldabern [4d\]: is question
zari [3k\]: one eye is not enough
SpicySpice [12k\]: and blck is threatening to cut both above and to the right

USSRMan [3d\]: 150k
SpicySpice [12k\]: yeah white has like 1/3 of the board completely for free
drueknmstr [3d\]: yes lee sedol gets paid for each match
kadoban [?\]: Lee gets a certain amount of money for each game just playing
drueknmstr [3d\]: each round
USSRMan [3d\]: 20k if he wins the round
jytsao [?\]: i have to assume that this game is about pride more than money for Lee
glasszee [2k\]: on d15:  "Oh my god! i couldnt imagie this." - cho hyeyeon 9p
kadoban [?\]: More for winning, and $1mill for winning the whole match (which now seems unlikely)
GoIngo [?\]: $150,000 + 20,000 for each win
robsclone: b8'ish?
USSRMan [3d\]: so there is some incentive to play for win
SpicySpice [12k\]: 100k, "some incentive"
iambad [2d?\]: k12 seems an overplay now...
oldguy [4d\]: that's a lot, usd150k?
PaleFire [18k?\]: Lee Sedol can't afford to lose 0-5, regardless of the money promised
USSRMan [3d\]: yeah

USSRMan [3d\]: of course he can
Azal [2d\]: b needs to escape :P

feeldabern [4d\]: black will have to pay with his weak group soon
BLikeWater [3d\]: g9

Azal [2d\]: i think lee needs 1 handy

rsun [-\]: his dead groups are usually resurrected 100 moves later in the game
Trevoke [?\]: Cho Hyeyon just said "I want to learn from AlphaGo"
Themonster: 7 dan are wayyy more stronger than 3d kgs, you're pretty weak compared to them but that's not the subject
BLikeWater [3d\]: i want to see alpha go give lee 2 stones in the last two games
HeartXiao [3k\]: i want to see lee play a no komi game 
Eternal6k [4k\]: At what cost?
USSRMan [3d\]: not against someone who does not make tactical mistakes
Tictactoe [-\]: yes , sedol is a daredevil, but alph won't get nervous like other humans

escudero [3k\]: what is ke jie saying about this?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: damn
Trevoke [?\]: Hah, this tool to guess the next move is pretty slick
AnthonyC [3k\]: i recall ke jie play very fast
kdbaby14 [6k\]: Lee only has 53 min
Fastnarion [7k\]: but alphago is also "thinking" on lee's time right ? 
GoIngo [?\]: my personal guess: the game will be over before move 80
Mig [6k\]: is black snake dead or it has a way to run?
Shenzao [14k?\]: AlphaGo still has 1:31:36
Qualx [1d?\]: Lee's thinking on AlphaGo's time too
TuLy [4k\]: it made move constantly about 1-2 min.

skima: I want to play with single PC version of AlphaGo
oonicks: we should not be intimidated alphago can be expected to play the best moves to kill a group , i hope lee tries to live and it will be enough

jytsao [?\]: akechi, what don't you understand, i can translate
USSRMan [3d\]: maybe lee will take 2 stones from OmegaGo
Codexus [7k?\]: I think Lee Sedol would rather eat the stones than take handicap from a computer

Akechi [4k\]: 正确
kdbaby14 [6k\]: W+time lol
USSRMan [3d\]: even if lee has 5 hours, i dont think he can win
shinigami [2d?\]: apparently e8 removing a liberty is very important as B could force a semeai with some forcing moves at d16, g15, and then finally h11 to surround W
Rolla [2d\]: 我在哪里呆了10年
nestango [3k\]: : )
Penfold [5k?\]: A go bot should fit in a lift and not suffer from overheating.
ixido [8k\]: not easy ben. i usually give time differential as handi

trippin [2k\]: redond getting deep with the philosophy right now =)
trippin [2k\]: intuition is a subsconscious memory
USSRMan [3d\]: lee vs alpha game 2 was pretty even up to move 70ish according to commentary
oonicks: out out out that is too small:)
HeartXiao [3k\]: this game looks over 
rsun [-\]: you see how the heaviest group is so inconveniently sandwiched between the other weak group and his moyo: by running out, the two stones are going to die, and the moyo will disappear
USSRMan [3d\]: this , white is clearly better by move 50
jytsao [?\]: can someone give a link to any chinese live commentary?
iceweasel [-\]: Lee was looking for weaknesses in all the wrong places
robsclone: i'm still calling black, so far
rsun [-\]: just go to weiqitv
narugo [1d\]: looks worst game for lee so far, not good because alpha win others
shindogo [5d?\]: Lee knows more than y  iceweas

gofrit [-\]: don't look SE, is bad :D
trippin [2k\]: he thinks alphago thinks it isahead
leachy [2k\]: maybe just trying to keep split, taffy
Trevoke [?\]: Redmong says f5 is very safe move, so AlphaGo likely thinks it's ahead
oonicks: i think just math f5
testerr [1d\]: white has great potential at the bottom
USSRMan [3d\]: redmond used my word "calm"
shinigami [2d?\]: next time someone tells me empty triangle is bad, i'm showing them this game
GoIngo [?\]: cs: 26.5 for white +- 22 now
cutcutcut: e6 a bit odd, kicking g9 in the teeth :/

USSRMan [3d\]: lol cs thinks white completely won
alobar [9k\]: empty triangle is only bad under certain conditions
c137: f8 is problematic 
testerr [1d\]: this triangle is strong because it can cut b at F9

;W[qr]C[Intagrand [?\]: All matches have been one sided.
trippin [2k\]: redmond says it could be close
danielhast [4k?\]: Redmond: it could still be a close game
mate105 [1d\]: So "trying to capture the big group" plan failed?
robgv [7k\]: AlphaGo has a lot of new architecture. It's not just a neural network or just mcts or even just the combination of the two. Probably only the Google team knows what it's good and bad at at this point.
rsun [-\]: CS "30%" Redmon "close game"; who should we trust
Yony1984 [10k\]: How can Lee even attack w's bottom?
JBoutte [5k\]: Would Lee play ultra risky for himslef and alphago to push the instinct part of this game ?
narugo [1d\]: first game did not look one sided
drueknmstr [3d\]: evaluation network evaluates whole board, my understanding, and policy network just finds hot points for candidate moves
USSRMan [3d\]: "close game"? All the strong MC bots says white won already
oonicks: especially not yourslef ofcourse:)
GoIngo [?\]: redmond has problem: he has no bot for sonsultation
danielhast [4k?\]: AGA stream back up
GoIngo [?\]: consultation
trippin [2k\]: redmond has called it close in game 1 & 2 when alpha was ahead
drueknmstr [3d\]: no reason it couldnt find life and death for 14 point dragon from that
robgv [7k\]: mate105, Redmond said that H17 pretty well fixed up the white group.
voevius [5k\]: alphago basically has 3 ingredients: 1. Neural net to predict which moves are worthwhile given the current board. 2. Neural net to predeict chance of winning making a certain move. 3. Tree search to read out future moves.
buhaypa [3k\]: Kim called both games close as well
voevius [5k\]: It can use 1,2 to direct the tree search. 
Syptryn [2d\]: can black attach like R10 now as a probe?
oonicks: if w can invade or reduce the bottom still it is close, between humans i would not exclude the possibility
Intagrand [?\]: Human's can't compete with this level
danielhast [4k?\]: Cho's count: W has 55+ points, B has ~40 points on board
danielhast [4k?\]: Cho: if I were black, I would think about resigning here
miai [1d\]: redmond: 50-50
feeldabern [4d\]: b also has future b8 ko to deal with, while white has his large dragon to deal wih
Intagrand [?\]: He will resign

danielhast [4k?\]: yes, Cho Hyeyeon is commenting on the AGA stream
BLikeWater [3d\]: still attack right side
Hannoskaj [?\]: Redmond is "lying" for suspense. Did it every game. Refused to count, gave count for each area up to five points! He's a ro, he evaluates the whole board much more precisely, heis just deciding not to say it.
Hannoskaj [?\]: *pro

weiqi5 [3k?\]: I trust the China-Korea judgement more
GoIngo [?\]: cs: 30 % now
danielhast [4k?\]: Cho: attacking group on right side is only hope for B
Syptryn [2d\]: wierd
feeldabern [4d\]: s14 could come
RoadHobo [6k\]: in my kyu games you can bet that black would try to live in the bottom area
Syptryn [2d\]: I don't understand this move
USSRMan [3d\]: black needs to make territory
oonicks: i am not going to follow a jp lesson
Slarty [1d\]: "A19 is playable" doesn't sound like AI propaganda, but that's a decoy to get you buying the rest of it
feeldabern [4d\]: r15 is the biggest point of endgame
Kettu [5d\]: final try to attack something
USSRMan [3d\]: lee knows he is behind
Kettu [5d\]: it's not for points, i think it's to make a "do or die" fight
weiqi5 [3k?\]: Invasion in the bottom? On WBaduk for sure, on KGS usually not... :D
feeldabern [4d\]: probably b wants r11 to lose it's base
bibooux [2k\]: C8 leave an aji

leachy [2k\]: ancient history, tim....i can't remember all that
BrainCore [3k\]: leachy: I find that quite likely. 
GoIngo [?\]: cs estimates: 30.5 for white +- 16
tim5407 [3k\]: thank you tictactoe
kadoban [?\]: The ko thing is just a stupid meme, it has no foundation.

kadoban [?\]: 5 months ago when alphago was weaker, it played ko fine.
ingen [?\]: RIP Lee Kappa
leachy [2k\]: well there was plenty of discussion about that at the time....just look at what people said and you'll find the answer
kiku: rip
Hmmm: tim it was q10
Hmmm: because it was
tim5407 [3k\]: USSRMan>> why a10 instead of c8
storn [2k\]: Hi everyone. Sedol's color?

USSRMan [3d\]: c8 leaves a ko threat
storn [2k\]: Thanks
KoyoToya [-\]: I think alpha go is accumulating its experience as learning...
USSRMan [3d\]: not playing c8 leaves a ko threat
KoyoToya [-\]: Because it's playing faster and faster each game
tim5407 [3k\]: c8 d8 a10 no?
bibooux [2k\]: yes
trippin [2k\]: koyotoya, alphago is the same since agme 1
tetriseyes [?\]: They said it is read-only during these matches
tim5407 [3k\]: oh ok..

;B[rd]C[weaknoob: AlphaGo is frozen 
JBoutte [5k\]: The learning capacities of AlphaGo are disabled during these 5 games
gofrit [-\]: what about black R10 ou R12 ?
tim5407 [3k\]: so its some high level mentality lol thanks USSRMan
storn [2k\]: Omg. What happened at bottom 0_o
trippin [2k\]: also, it doesn't learn anything from small numbers of games
narugo [1d\]: was it iced like month ago or smthing
glasszee [2k\]: if anything, the fact that the results are changing says a lot about the HUMAN inconsistenciesthat cause psychological struggles
squid [?\]: The program is frozen, but not the built in learning that is inherent
wolvie [?\]: That would make sense; training AlphaGo during this series raises the risk of improper training
trippin [2k\]: it needs 1,000's and 10s of 1,000s
JBoutte [5k\]: @trippin : yes it could, focusing on a peculiar player ...
BrainCore [3k\]: leachy: i also think that lee sedol knows this ko avoidance and tries to dominate alpha go by this small weakness. but alphago is too far ahead in strength to make it exploitable.
ingen [?\]: @KoyoToya they specifically said AlphaGo would not be training between these matches, so the strength should be the same for all these games
Hmmm: oh ok
Intagrand [?\]: Q15?
Iciac [5k?\]: I wonder how many times "Eye of the Tiger" was played during AlphaGo's training 
Kaidjin [?\]: Try to guess the next move! The leading guesser only has 15 points. http://gomoveguesser.ab0.fr
USSRMan [3d\]: q15 is bad
Iciac [5k?\]: As it's clearly paid dividends 
Intagrand [?\]: Q15 29% Crazystone
USSRMan [3d\]: bad for endgame
Tictactoe [-\]: alph one hour left
cutcutcut: a bit more seriously, I'd be rather curious to see Lee Sedol's best attempt at living in white's bottom area, I bet it'd take a fairly strong player to kill it because dude can make things complex... and if alphago is weak at traditional L&D - which monte carlo often is - then it might even have an off chance of working
feeldabern [4d\]: q15 might be good in this case
oonicks: i take it it has not been updated.. they also said tehy ran 20 million or so simulations of lsd games between the first two matches
GoIngo [?\]: only a miracle can help black
leachy [2k\]: you can't live there, cutcutcut

tim5407 [3k\]: man watching alphago just like the ancient mythology 
jellyroll: is there nothing in the lower side for b?
USSRMan [3d\]: the way alphago handles weak groups is amazing

nkrach [2k\]: alphago must think it's winning if it gave up that aji
robgv [7k\]: That's just mean.
Cyphase [?\]: google should have put a bit of effort into a robot to play AlphaGo's moves :)

kiku: kami no itte
voevius [5k\]: cho had good explanation for this.
USSRMan [3d\]: what does alphago sees?
feeldabern [4d\]: it's just aji to make the center group 2 eyes
Codexus [7k?\]: alphago is such a show-off :)
oonicks: b18 means: there must be little room at the bottom to invade
feeldabern [4d\]: better than playing g18 directly
BrainCore [3k\]: robgv: yes it could, but the koreans/chinese commenters all think it is, so your alternative is not likely, right?
]
;B[dd]C[miai [1d\]: breakfast style move, probably no follow up soon
DrSFBrains [1k\]: B must be delighted to have time trouble here...
inte [?\]: the policy and also the value network certainly "know" about eye shapes, false eyes, etc. no search required. this is different from MC bots up to the end of last year
josh858: I like how Garland says, "ok so this move causes.." and waits for Redmond to reply, and then he repeats what Redmond says as if that's what he was thinking
BrainCore [3k\]: robgv: at some point we might watch two different super strong go engines battle each other. and when they are much stronger than 9p human, we might be in situations where we don't really know why a strange move is played ;-)
lurrch [?\]: Anyone know if alphago does timesuji? 
cutcutcut: inte: difficult L&D problems can require exhaustive search, no matter how good the heuristic it's not necessarily good enough
USSRMan [3d\]: this happens when two strong chess AI plays against each other
danielhast [4k?\]: Gu Li reportedly saying there might still be a chance for B
pCeitin [2k\]: It's might be beautiful to watch alphago play itself

python111: Will B18 work?
Shiny [?\]: Googles AI vs Facebooks AI once theyve caught up?
bababobo [1d?\]: It's a computer. In Hex. "DEAD FACE B1D5 0DD5"
BrainCore [3k\]: pCeitin: the team of alphago had this joy for a long time :)
Codexus [7k?\]: the team answered that alphago doesn't care about the opponent's clock
USSRMan [3d\]: facebook a decade away
hgfh: can't believe B18 can appear in pros games :o
narugo [1d\]: if other side L&D problem plays pro level it definetely helps search
Syptryn [2d\]: E-18 works?
robgv [7k\]: Maybe. I was referring to the statements from the developer team that AG is designed to play for best chance of winning, not margin of victory. It plays slow, safe moves when its analysis leads to it winning in some high enough percentage of games. B2 doesn't seem to fit that pattern.
DrSFBrains [1k\]: Whether alphago cares about Sedol's clock or not, I guarantee that Sedol cares.
oonicks: so to see b18 prevents all ko
G361 [10k\]: h14
drueknmstr [3d\]: facebook just behind, they started using pattern recognition with conv net + mcts, deepmind came up with this full, effective architecture faster however
inte [?\]: anyway. I agree it would be interesting to see an all out attack on the bottom; I don't think that Lee would outplay the computer though.
BrainCore [3k\]: hgfh: uber taxi should develop a stronger engine and then say "he's not 9p, he's uber-pro"
Hmmm: Hmm
drueknmstr [3d\]: alphago started with just pure pattern recognitiion, like facebook's bot

highhand [5k\]: wonder if one version of AlphaGo play with another version, what will happen?
Intagrand [?\]: White wins 5 games :)
Hmmm: both win
voevius [5k\]: one will win.
Hanne [?\]: is b still hoping to win this somehow?
gohand2 [1d\]: a breakdown? :)
drueknmstr [3d\]: highland that is how it trains, it plays by itself and learns new patterns from these games
voevius [5k\]: and you can use the information of the winner to train the loser network to get a bit stronger.
Elios: highhand thats how the AI works
]
;B[cb]C[voevius [5k\]: THat's how alphago played itself to get better.
drueknmstr [3d\]: initially it trained pattern recognition by observing human games
drueknmstr [3d\]: * replaying human games
kiet321 [?\]: c18?
Elios: in this case it plays it self a bunch of times and uses the verserion that wins more
estridento [2k?\]: maybe he always win with white the human will have to change komi ^^^
akrasia [?\]: so...
Butcher [1k\]: now b8 ko:-)
feeldabern [4d\]: maybe he always win with black

mate105 [1d\]: Yeah DM team should give that info about b/w advantage :)
estridento [2k?\]: its a fucking ko coming, like black was waiting for it from start
bromeas [1k?\]: does B get seki at upper left?
BrainCore [3k\]: it's actually a good point: when alphago and others make it likely to think that 4.5 komi or 8.5 komi are fair, should it be changed in human rules, or should the komi stay at "fair level for incomplete human abilities"?
Ilyo: There is another mirror, I was wondering why no one joined it ^^'
jellyroll: alive
Nachos [17k?\]: AlphaGo displays his confidence levele to google deepmind team. I wish they would display that with the game

robgv [7k\]: Me too Nachos.

akrasia [?\]: jeez..
BrainCore [3k\]: can someone explain again why b18 and b17? why not start somewhere from the outside?
frozensoul [-\]: the reason is not to kill
Shanti [1k\]: I'm reviewing the game with a few strong players, they say it's impossible to make life at bottom, even laugh at me
frozensoul [-\]: it indirectly helps whites h16 group
miai [1d\]: 6th line territory vs 2nd line

GoIngo [?\]: cs gives 27 % for black now
gaia001 [5k\]: no
Wizardry [4d\]: r10 something for b?
BrainCore [3k\]: Heatmap or winning probability or so: If Alphago showed this during a game it would be a biggeer difference between a human go player. humans don't chat aloud during a game either. So while I'd find it tempting to see it, I feel it's a better endgame match if this does not happen. Maybe alphago can have some "casual games" without price money, where it shows a heatmap or evaluation and all stuff.
gaia001 [5k\]: black ok in the corner
Intagrand [?\]: 25% with L8
jellyroll: at least seki
gaia001 [5k\]: yes

GoIngo [?\]: crazy stone, french bot

voevius [5k\]: True braincore, it would be cool to have it after the game.
tim5407 [3k\]: will b try to live on the bottom? Everyone would like to see how w will handle the L&D!
GoIngo [?\]: my cs wants L12
oonicks: well if alphago knows a sequence to live at the bottom and you would happenstance play the first move of it, would it allow you to live at the bottom?
voevius [5k\]: It would also be nice to see which moves it would consider for black, we can see if the "human" plays optimal.

ToastyKen: maybe at this point he's just tyring to test alphago?
Ilyo: Those were end game where there was no chance of point fluctuation..
oonicks: no the second and first game he played out a whole way 
ToBeStrong [2k\]: I dont need to bromeas, redmond showed it on stream
Turnipsi [1k\]: those resignations were deep in the endgame, the games might have been within 5 points but totally hopeless
highhand [5k\]: but after this corner w play m3 seal corner
JBoutte [5k\]: @drueknmstr : is it ?
USSRMan [3d\]: a move like q14 will end it, no more weak shape, 15 points ahead
highhand [5k\]: seal lower side
]
;B[qk]C[USSRMan [3d\]: lowerside already sealed
feeldabern [4d\]: b has to try to kill right but...
feeldabern [4d\]: it's really desperate
esrig [6k\]: in the games w was training on, were there resign-time moves?
qzx1198 [18k?\]: what is seki
drueknmstr [3d\]: for me anyway, maybe a stronger playe can tell the difference.  for me i would normally look at point difference
USSRMan [3d\]: but alphago doesnt die
amadis [4k\]: is there a way to see the move numbers on the board?
esrig [6k\]: seki is stalemate ... neither side can proceed
drueknmstr [3d\]: for example how many points would komi need to be for it to be an even game with lsd?
esrig [6k\]: it applies to a group, not the game as a whole
GoIngo [?\]: only above: 113 now
]
;W[pk]C[bromeas [1k?\]: I figured B got seki with a17
USSRMan [3d\]: i'd like to see alphago beat lee with reverse komi
jytsao [?\]: seki literally means "both alive"
esrig [6k\]: or rather, to two or more groups in contact
Naphthalin [10k?\]: @drunkenmaster: w's value network is trained with 7,5 komi, chinese rules
ToBeStrong [2k\]: bromeass seki is a18....
gromgull [?\]: amadis: if you click "view offline" you can turn on numbering
ausrussell [4k\]: Now for the comeback
Dntinferno [1d\]: gg sedol
drueknmstr [3d\]: naphthalin ag is stronger than lsd apparently, but how much stronger is what im asking
drueknmstr [3d\]: how much would komi need to be for lsd to have an even game
Naphthalin [10k?\]: i wanted to answer that question by saying it is hard to tell with this exact version
azblueeyes [8k\]: control "L" puts letters back on
Naphthalin [10k?\]: because they would have to train a value network with different komi
drueknmstr [3d\]: i see
bromeas [1k?\]: yes i figured it b plays a17 agins a18
SIeracle [-\]: players time?
drueknmstr [3d\]: maybe they could just adjust the value network by the komi points
]
;B[lo]C[kaliya [-\]: Alpha 50, Lee 10
bababobo [1d?\]: b position seems desperate
drueknmstr [3d\]: the output of the value network i mean

tim5407 [3k\]: oh
tim5407 [3k\]: yea!
robgv [7k\]: Woah
icecream99 [1d?\]: ladder breaker
drueknmstr [3d\]: although i gues the value network evaluates 1=win not number of points
ausrussell [4k\]: yo
voevius [5k\]: the man won't go down without a fight.
feeldabern [4d\]: | ---> /
tim5407 [3k\]: everyone is waiting for that!!!

Elios: huh
ruby [2d\]: "Lee Sedol is getting fancy "
USSRMan [3d\]: desperate
Anatoly [2d?\]: WOW
GreenCoder [7k?\]: Is it a modern way to say "I give up", or it actually works ?
oonicks: he played them out that much ..
fatih [1d\]: nice ladder breaker
Dntinferno [1d\]: WAOW
Turnipsi [1k\]: w would a17 and not 18, if he had time and any bloodlust left
cutcutcut: meh, that's just a sacrifice :(
Elios: he going to try to invade?
Ilyo: q.q
anton007 [-\]: nice move
Thundergod [7d\]: hoping for a ladder breaker
LEIBNIZ [2k\]: YaaHooo!
drueknmstr [3d\]: very creative but i think ag can parry
Naphthalin [10k?\]: @drunkenmaster: let's continue in CG room
highhand [5k\]: w n6 look instinct response to m5 (5k view)
Ilyo: I think he may of missed the ladder like Cho said
Naphthalin [10k?\]: too full here
tim5407 [3k\]: even LSD wants to see how alpha will approach!!!
trippin [2k\]: wow
kaliya [-\]: What are other pros saying now?
Jermelle [?\]: m5 kame no itte

;W[mn]C[voevius [5k\]: see what the computer can do.
njs [1d\]: m5 is beautiful
ArcticDawn [6k\]: Go Lee!!!!
tim5407 [3k\]: oh!
cekalo [1k\]: redmond just explained theh move wow
JBoutte [5k\]: Is it a winning ladder for lee, according to them
feeldabern [4d\]: at this point lee wants his money's worth for this teaching game
tim5407 [3k\]: n6!
danielhast [4k?\]: Cho Hyeyeon is saying Lee Sedol knows he's lost the game, and is testing AlphaGo's strength
ArcticDawn [6k\]: Never give up! Give it to alphaGo!
Ilyo: @kaliya Cho is saying that M5 was because he didn't see the lower ladder and focused on the upper one. She thinks it was a mistake.
BrainCore [3k\]: cekalo, can you explain? my vpn and utube got disconnected
Anatoly [2d?\]: Redmond explains: "this move makes q10 possible for black"
JBoutte [5k\]: but Alphago cleverer :p
robgv [7k\]: feeldabern, ha.
Elios: here comes the ladder!
USSRMan [3d\]: obvious move
danielhast [4k?\]: Cho: AG winning by 30 points
alobar [9k\]: after three losses what does he want to test?
njs [1d\]: Lee has 9 minutes left... crap
Nyai [1d\]: Ilyo: That is not what she was saying at all.
voevius [5k\]: hahahah, cho, try not to review the game ;-)
Eternal6k [4k\]: I predicted ag win but this is brutal
Ilyo: She said exactly that  Nyai
highhand [5k\]: can w cut off j8 and kill b dragon?
Nyai [1d\]: No, she missed the ladder, but not Lee
Ilyo: She said she thinks he must of missed it too.
feeldabern [4d\]: the b dragon has weakness but w doesn't need to exploit it
voevius [5k\]: The strongest go player in history has arrived....
Shanti [1k\]: They say white'moyo is shaped like a dog
Ilyo: And after he played M5 he started hitting him self in the head.
Cyphase [?\]: Shanti, i can see that
Shanti [1k\]: Dog is the cute surname of alpha go
bromeas [1k?\]: w a17 + wb8 create 2 kos against B to exchange kodates
botBot: w moyo looks like god?
esrig [6k\]: what ladder
kdbaby14 [6k\]: M-5 was purposely aiming at breaking the ladder
Shanti [1k\]: So, it's a Chinese pun... Not that anyone cares
BrainCore [3k\]: i do
highhand [5k\]: w a18 kills b in corner?
Ilyo: Yes it was aiming for the ladder breaker, but only as an attempt to makeup for his mistake
USSRMan [3d\]: black has no chance
Elios: is there really no way for B to live in the bottom?
NateC [3d\]: If b players q10, r10 s9 p10 q11 o9 was a ladder
blau3: esrig: B Q10 R10 S9 P10 Q11 O9

;B[pj]C[Elios: such a big area

Hanne [?\]: it's a shame that there is so little time for this great game!

;W[qj]C[Syptryn [2d\]: aprevents Q-2 from being sente
Gor [3d?\]: doesnt it work even if w ignores n5?
Gor [3d?\]: m5*

oldguy [4d\]: for sente
IronCow [2d?\]: last attempt. kill something
gofrit [-\]: he want to finish sente to make use of  M5 i bet
Naphthalin [10k?\]: as redmond just explained: b doesn't want w to get p10 p11
YogSothoth [1d\]: I guess Lee tries to live in the bottom as a resign-suji
YogSothoth [1d\]: also to test alphago

;W[rk]C[rs220675 [2d\]: Sedol wants to live in white's moyo...he's preparing his try I think

GreenCoder [7k?\]: R9 ? (he he)
njs [1d\]: which he doesnt
oonicks: making p2 small btw
oonicks: how about m2?
G361 [10k\]: r9 ne semble pas être évident pour AlphaGo ...
gofrit [-\]: hum i don't know about H5 black move seems cutting white but  not sure
weiqi5 [3k?\]: btw: the chinese pro on WeiqiTV are also using Zen winning rate estimators. (They also have an AI specialist as guest.)
kaliya [-\]: Does Alpha care about shapes, efficiency etc or just goes for territory?

;W[qk]C[njs [1d\]: tu plaisant g361
akrasia [?\]: we don't know
]
;B[cr]C[Elios: unlikely
tim5407 [3k\]: ko!
voevius [5k\]: alpha go maximizes chance of winning, it doesn't care how ;-)
Syptryn [2d\]: ?
Elios: it may care about eyes and life and death
oldguy [4d\]: b2! b2! b2!
G361 [10k\]: Non. J'évoque son temps de réponse.
kaliya [-\]: Yeah
Ilyo: Kaliya, yes but it is a bit different than you likely think.
USSRMan [3d\]: this is big ko
Elios: but other then that not really
JBoutte [5k\]: Important question : Is AlphaGo able to bluff ?
weiqi5 [3k?\]: "I wonder if they switcched colors, AlphaGo would still win?" (comment on AGA)
GoIngo [?\]: what are zen % here ?
Ilyo: It cares more about the lack of stone shapes than the stone shapes.
oldguy [4d\]: wanna see ko so much
Syptryn [2d\]: woukdn't white just Q2 now?
oonicks: if he gets ko he can play m2 alpha will d3
kaliya [-\]: I think W can L5
AkiSanKaku [-\]: zen 77%
njs [1d\]: black is down on territory
G361 [10k\]: AlphaGo met autant de temps que ce soit simple ou difficile ...
YogSothoth [1d\]: I don't think this is big enough for b to threaten to win
AkiSanKaku [-\]: finaliti
BrainCore [3k\]: maybe b tries to win two kos at the same time. and maybe it can work.
python111: someone updates pro's opinions pls
USSRMan [3d\]: m5 has no aji
alobar [9k\]: ko is a gimmick that is now out dated
BrainCore [3k\]: ko is too hard for alphago.
Cyphase [?\]: shapes, efficiency, etc are just words people use for patterns they see that happen to lead to victory. alphago doesn't care about those words
ArcticDawn [6k\]: ko attack! b has a lot of threats to live at the bottom!
Becubio [3k\]: c2 what? seems to be small, better q14 or L12
Ilyo: That's not true Cyphase.
feeldabern [4d\]: c2 to hope desperately for some kind of ko erroor
kaliya [-\]: W will ignore this ko
]
;W[pf]C[tim5407 [3k\]: lol
ffksd: rude
USSRMan [3d\]: nice choice
ArcticDawn [6k\]: corner is quite a bit of stones
USSRMan [3d\]: just play thick
alobar [9k\]: correct cyphase alpha is pure intelligence without habit
tim5407 [3k\]: alphagod ignored the desperate attempt
Hanne [?\]: well it's true that b doesn't know these words, in fact it doesn't even know its opponents name
oonicks: 4.5 points won by lee with w evading ko's but not yet enough
Hanne [?\]: w I mean
Nachos [17k?\]: ignoring it just makes him stronger somewhere else
Cyphase [?\]: though certainly, parts of the neural net could possibly be identified as imitating certain human concepts
USSRMan [3d\]: black didnt win any points, q14 is quite big
Deterra [?\]: Can Black play at E2?
feeldabern [4d\]: q14 probably bigger than the ko
Ilyo: I think you may be mistaking the purpose of a Neural net..
Becubio [3k\]: C2 what!!!
NH3CH2COOH [4k\]: if b f15 what then
feeldabern [4d\]: w also has infinite threats at a17
feeldabern [4d\]: so it's hard to fight ko here
USSRMan [3d\]: no
USSRMan [3d\]: g14
Mormegil [3k\]: only does reading and ositional judgement.....
USSRMan [3d\]: h14 i mean
GreenCoder [7k?\]: Could bS13 work, to intimidate white ?
BrainCore [3k\]: feedbabern: hard to know for alphago.
USSRMan [3d\]: anyways, hard to attack white's top because a17 is ko
esrig [6k\]: it's hard to pull out parts in a neural net unless the structure of the neural net is predefined in a way that localizes them
gofrit [-\]: lee in byo-yomi ?
bromeas [1k?\]: green u can intimidate people nor bots
Hanne [?\]: w stong

K5 [5k?\]: Intimidating software won't work

Cyphase [?\]: esrig, that's true; i only said possibly ;)
USSRMan [3d\]: did you see its game vs fanhui
Reym [-\]: 3min left before lee in byoyomi
USSRMan [3d\]: it is fine at ko
njs [1d\]: because i looks like l
K5 [5k?\]: I'm not :-)
GreenCoder [7k?\]: I mean .. maybe to force that white group to run, and benefit from it to attack the bigger white dragon.
tim5407 [3k\]: lol intimidating software
Feulieton: oh, ok
Le0na99 [4k\]: Lee Sedol having only 2 minutes left
Hanul [5k?\]: this just isn't looking good for lsd

CardCaptor [2k\]: go to the mountains and train for 10 years
BrainCore [3k\]: i think lee sedol is doing exactly the right thing. he is trying different things in different games and doesnt resign early. he wants to show the world that this go engine is really better than humans.
Codexus [7k?\]: Lee Sedol has no choice but to take a big chance
DrSFBrains [1k\]: TheCaptain would use the J3 stone to kill all of White's groups.

anton007 [-\]: wow
TaoTao: the last fight.
Jermelle [?\]: he's still playing?
njs [1d\]: Lee gonna run outa time like a boss
hgfh: aiming at F6
kaliya [-\]: Yes
Casanova [3d\]: wtf.. this is already embarassing for Lee.. just resing.. why play like 20k
tim5407 [3k\]: why everyone saying b resigned? did he?
miai [1d\]: hard to read out
aoyagi [2d\]: ?
ToBeStrong [2k\]: Casanova doesnt understand what aji means
oldguy [4d\]: agreed, Casanova 
gofrit [-\]: no he didn't
ArcticDawn [6k\]: eventually go will be figured out by the computer I think.
ToBeStrong [2k\]: go back to go school
ArcticDawn [6k\]: Nope not resigned yet!
easyrobot [2k\]: Casanova, LSD is focus on F6 cut
kaliya [-\]: Does he think to connect under F2?! Maybe the purpose of the corner ko
Thundergod [7d\]: casanova is too strong
bromeas [1k?\]: w h5 blocks all
mate105 [1d\]: I think Lee is doing a good job of exploring AG for DM team.
tim5407 [3k\]: its awesome for Lee to play like this. He just wants to play. He doesnt care about his image.
Madzilla [1d?\]: this isn't so easy
Casanova [3d\]: i'm not too strong... but to play like this is poor attitude for a 9 dan pro
BrainCore [3k\]: mate105: Lee is helping to make sure that other go players don't have a chance against AG anymore, hehe
gromgull [?\]: They says AG doesn't try to win big, once it's confident it'll play as safe as possible... I wonder if they can have fiddled with komi to make AG want to win MORE? 
njs [1d\]: This isn't playing like a 20k
njs [1d\]: Don't make up bs
oonicks: alphago is used to exploit human weaknesses, and lee is not showing them, i expect w resigns finally
Naphthalin [10k?\]: he isn't playing a human

;W[ip]C[Cyphase [?\]: Casanova, AlphaGo isn't going to feel disrespected :)
Naphthalin [10k?\]: so it's not insulting
godzylla [?\]: b8 is sente
Intagrand [?\]: This match shouldn't negatively affect his image.
mate105 [1d\]: Yes 
Intagrand [?\]: No one alive can beat AlphaGo
Gor [3d?\]: maybe black aims to play p2 in sente and then take r2 stone
miai [1d\]: some thing coming up
Thundergod [7d\]: casanove:5% of his moves you can hardly understand so please,just show some respect
mate105 [1d\]: It will definitely change his mental strength.
Casanova [3d\]: i'm not talking about alphago being disrespected... i'm talking about Lee Sedol's "art" ... why play like a 20kyu?
aoyagi [2d\]: very hard
hanspi [12k\]: It is interesting that AlphaGo has learnt to evade ko situations when lots of people assumed ko would be its weakness
]
;B[hp]C[Wizardry [4d\]: the point is nobody cares what you think, we are trying to watch what Lee thinks
K5 [5k?\]: I suspect the team spent a lot of time on ko strategy
DrSFBrains [1k\]: I really hope that with the next match the byo-yomi periods are longer.
Justin9202 [7k\]: black still needs A18 to live in the upper left
aoyagi [2d\]: mm.....
alobar [9k\]: why play to human expectation when humans are so weak?
K5 [5k?\]: since that is well known weak point of bots
pipu [6d\]: what does cs say?
marian [1d?\]: b alive
Eternal6k [4k\]: Lol
hanspi [12k\]: @K5: sure, but how to teach that to a neural network?
Casanova [3d\]: Go Seigen said that the strength of a go player is shown best in ko fights.. maybe alphago doesn't want to show how strong it really is :)
BrainCore [3k\]: hanspi: i'm not sure whether the deepmind team has taught him to avoid ko if possible or whether it has taught itself
USSRMan [3d\]: cs cant read this
trippin [2k\]: heh
DrSFBrains [1k\]: SE has awesome theories about this position
Intagrand [?\]: J,2 21.85% playout = 1.6 million 
kadoban [?\]: No idea where the ko thing came from. AlphaGo did fine at ko 5 months ago, why would it have gotten worse?
Nachos [17k?\]: I dont think AG values KO fights as much as humans
]
;W[io]C[hanspi [12k\]: @BrainCore: I have looked at the Nature paper, and if AlphaGo is still the same, it can only learn by itself
Nachos [17k?\]: it can find more valuable move elsewhere
miai [1d\]: k4 first?
MrM [3k\]: if AG avoids ko.. it isnt that worthfully
Justin9202 [7k\]: hmm
Madzilla [1d?\]: we might actually see a ko fight at D3 since W doesn't really want to have to take B off the board (semedori)
kaliya [-\]: Pros use ko a lot in their games... Is Alpha teaching us that strategy is: 1) ensure a huge territory on one side 2) avoid kos ?
Cyphase [?\]: down to the wire!
Justin9202 [7k\]: i raelly hope black wins he is down at least 7 points atm
USSRMan [3d\]: no
kiku: 3
kiku: 2
kiku: 1
Nachos [17k?\]: if you can avoid a 5 point ko to pick up 10 points elswhere why not?

;B[jr]C[alobar [9k\]: ko is a gimmick
USSRMan [3d\]: alphago doesnt avoid ko, its just q14 is so much bigger than that ko
squid [?\]: the Byo-Yomi time is not very important, but it would be better to have 5 hours for the game
trippin [2k\]: w will let h2 live, and use thickness to take center
marian [1d?\]: easily alive
alobar [9k\]: even 10 never play ko
hanspi [12k\]: @USSRMan: Spacibo
Nachos [17k?\]: that or it just knows its so far ahead it would rather play safe
alobar [9k\]: 10k*
Jermelle [?\]: g5 
storn [2k\]: Alobar, what??
K5 [5k?\]: Alphago maximises winning probability - so if ko makes global position evaluation uncertain, then it is natural to avoid it when ahead
USSRMan [3d\]: alphago strategy is to be so far ahead, that you just play safe for the rest of the game
esrig [6k\]: the wisdom of the 10k, eh alobar
alobar [9k\]: ko is a gimmick
Cyphase [?\]: gimmicko
]
;W[kr]C[alobar [9k\]: just take territory and win. no ko needed
Madzilla [1d?\]: so far we've pretty much only seen how AlphaGo plays when it feels it's winning...
marian [1d?\]: well said
kostuek [?\]: rip go
oonicks: we better hope for teh future of the universe h2 will not live
suicao [3d\]: difficult @@
Eternal6k [4k\]: Play Kos and gain 2ranks instantly
MrM [3k\]: pff
hanspi [12k\]: What I find MOST interesting is that everybody here talks of AlphaGo as if she was human. "AlphaGo's strategy ...", "AlpgaGo's plan ..."
inte [?\]: does w take more or less constant time per move, or does it vary noticably? (besides decreasing as the game progresses)
storn [2k\]: Eternal, ++
MrM [3k\]: i almost never play ko
Justin9202 [7k\]: eternal thats false
Nachos [17k?\]: I think that deep mind said it rarely gets below 50% confidence
Cyphase [?\]: hanspi, people have been saying "the AI" forever

BongoBob [-\]: does anyone have the live stream of lee's face?
miai [1d\]: :-)
Syptryn [2d\]: I don't uderstand, K4 instead of H3 would be a ko?

jellyroll: wow
KoyoToya [-\]: Lee sedol is just adorable, even if i could i wouldn't beat him
Justin9202 [7k\]: what aoubt j6
Intagrand [?\]: It would have been a better match if Lee Sedol could practice against AlphaGo at least 1 year ahead of the match
Madzilla [1d?\]: I thought so too, Syptryin, but there is no way Lee didn't see tha
Trevoke [?\]: JBoutte: it's always been about testing the algorithm

chenzg [14k\]: just feed him shusaaku kifu
USSRMan [3d\]: alphago already read 200m variations, and each says he wins
n00b [?\]: wtf
K5 [5k?\]: All recent comment about bot style remarks how much it is like strong pros...
K5 [5k?\]: So there are not as many weaknesses to exploit as before
Aram [3k\]: ussrman, so perhaps you feel that these games shouldn't take part at all? since every game you say the same thing? Lets see how Lee Sedol plays, every time we learn more about Alphago, and the Alphago team has more chances to find any possible weaknesses
alobar [9k\]: plenty weakness for AI to exploit now.
Eternal6k [4k\]: <.<
royu [4d\]: AlphaGo: "you might think you have just saved the game, but I will just send another Arnold Schwarzenegger back in time to defeat you"

bababobo [1d?\]: At least LSD seems to creating chances now.

chenzg [14k\]: the chance of alphago being at a level just close to lee is miniscule
kaliya [-\]: This is complicated but W can win it easily

kiet321 [?\]: F4444444444444444444?

ffksd: kill j17
kiku: Mortal kombat
royu [4d\]: alphago is cruel. it constantly gives you hope that you're coming back, only to ensure its victory
Elios: lol
TAZZ [-\]: so desu ne :)
kostuek [?\]: well, "funny" from human side
K5 [5k?\]: Not like strong human players when they player weaker ones then ... :-)
weiqidevil [-\]: does the super ko rule apply?
ithisa [25k\]: yes, it's chinese rules
aklan [15k\]: tenuki again!
ithisa [25k\]: superko is illegal move
UltraVires [?\]: not in chinese rules
]
;W[hn]C[TAZZ [-\]: hanami ko
ImNoSensei [-\]: has alpha go ever had to play catch-up? It would be interesting to compare what it does when behind to what pros would do
weiqidevil [-\]: superko is not a move…
papapishu [1d\]: it will be triple ko
MrM [3k\]: E1 hm?
tim5407 [3k\]: G6...
papapishu [1d\]: e1 d1 
hgfh: J3 is kghin's signature move
tim5407 [3k\]: H6
ImNoSensei [-\]: we know it has a decision making process that leads to surprising moves when ahead, but have we had a chance to see the other side of that?
TAZZ [-\]: e1 f4?
]
;B[ds]C[trippin [2k\]: if lee wins I will be amazed
Tictactoe [-\]: e1 would be answered at e2 by white
ithisa [25k\]: why is lsd not resigning?
fathwad [?\]: man byoyomi x1 is so freakin heart wrenching
njs [1d\]: Lee is such a clutcher
MrM [3k\]: you must been trippin
kiku: alpha go weak at ko :D?
TAZZ [-\]: niether nor the other, lol
trippin [2k\]: heh
ingen [?\]: much respect to Lee for continuing the game
Cyphase [?\]: it would be unbe-lee-vable
TuLy [4k\]: hope for Lee's win
Gor [3d?\]: alpha no ko
ohiioi: GO LEE  ))
tetriseyes [?\]: I'm impressed by how Lee has funneled the game towards Ko 
ingen [?\]: and for giving great fight with only 1 min per move
kaliya [-\]: Also this will be answered by E2
Madzilla [1d?\]: lee won't win - he already invested a lot in getting to this ko
trippin [2k\]: Cyphase: I lol'ed
njs [1d\]: lol you're seriously comparing kghin to lee sedol
trippin [2k\]: =D
njs [1d\]: nice joke
BrainCore [3k\]: it would be funny if b can live and kill in the bottom left, but loses the game anyway
fathwad [?\]: damn lee playing every move at 1s
USSRMan [3d\]: j18 is huge!
Becubio [3k\]: I think is time for a bottle of wine and a good cigarrette to watch this
]
;W[cq]C[kaliya [-\]: It took the ko
godzylla [?\]: the ko is a good raison to play e5
jlw2 [21k?\]: before AG played h6 couldn't lee have played it and follwed with j7 and c8?
TAZZ [-\]: k18
K5 [5k?\]: Hard to say, ImNoSensei. Commentators were quick to spot "blunders" in the earlier games that turned out on reflection to have  been clever strategic sacrificies. Probably.
BrainCore [3k\]: it took the ko, yeah
Deterra [?\]: lPlaying at 1s means he gets a bit more time to think.
tim5407 [3k\]: FINALLY
escudero [3k\]: the ko of the century
fathwad [?\]: but it makes me crap a brick :O
tim5407 [3k\]: AlphaKo
Isla [?\]: 终于提了
mamouth [4d\]: tic tac toe plays before youtube retransmission ^^
bababobo [1d?\]: Like Becubio comment
Becubio [3k\]: e5
BongoBob [-\]: humanity fighting infinity, against the robot..
tsukiatari [1d\]: this bot is so awesome
TAZZ [-\]: the crowds roar 
aklan [15k\]: he keeps thinking at opponents time?
tim5407 [3k\]: so finally even gods cant deny every challenge
Madzilla [1d?\]: F4?
Cyphase [?\]: tim5407, is that a mod for handling kos?
MrM [3k\]: e1 hm
Naphthalin [10k?\]: why does the deepmindstream show lsd's face when he is at 10s
Naphthalin [10k?\]: when he is supposed to play a move?
ausrussell [4k\]: they need headphones or bells telling them when there's a move played

Feanor [1d\]: 3rd

pCeitin [2k\]: 3rd
TAZZ [-\]: e1
lofuchi [3k\]: i forget the date :)
yamesh [8k?\]: kokokoko

Cyphase [?\]: if Lee wins, Zion will party tonight!

;W[eo]C[ingen [?\]: ^LOL
K5 [5k?\]: f4 maybe to get an extra ko threat?
Eternal6k [4k\]: Lol
TAZZ [-\]: long lives Zion...
kaliya [-\]: I don't think that W can lose here
BrainCore [3k\]: Redmond is so flexible with his explanations. He may at some point in the next moves say that there might be a possible chance of getting to a position with a ko somewhere on the board.
Becubio [3k\]: I LSD wins skynet learns and wins the next...
Becubio [3k\]: *if
kaliya [-\]: E1?
AA76 [5k?\]: Allez l'humanité!!
MrM [3k\]: e1 now?
]
;B[do]C[trippin [2k\]: redmond thinks b doesn't have large enough threats
TAZZ [-\]: yes
royu [4d\]: Morpheus stopped believing after Game 2 Cyphase
Intagrand [?\]: 15% Crazystone
BrainCore [3k\]: becubio: no, it cannot learn so quickly
Turnipsi [1k\]: learning is off now
BongoBob [-\]: learning is always.
jytsao [?\]: i read somewhere that they closed code for purposes of this 5-game match
goren22 [2k\]: when this happens in chess the humans resign.  local deep fights are the easiest for computers
Madzilla [1d?\]: At least Casanova finally shut up about how this was so obviously not alive and there was absolutely no possibilities for B ^^
Becubio [3k\]: ok
lofuchi [3k\]: can it be seki
TAZZ [-\]: does this computer fortell its future?
jytsao [?\]: i'm going to assume that after LSD matches, a-go will probably also be stronger than ke jie
]
;W[ep]C[bababobo [1d?\]: seems B has 0 ko-threats

;B[er]C[ingen [?\]: ダメ詰まり
Becubio [3k\]: so... if LSD wins, skynet kidnapp him to learn and conquer us
Madzilla [1d?\]: ?!
Blondin [4k\]: Sorry but who is black?
TAZZ [-\]: booom
BrainCore [3k\]: jytsao: exactly. and setting up the match will take a month or two, so alpha-go has just beaten mankind
godzylla [?\]: i difficult to play ko just for a true fight
MrM [3k\]: waaah
aklan [15k\]: g4
kiku: o_O
ithisa [25k\]: LSD is black
BongoBob [-\]: black is human
ithisa [25k\]: he's losing badly
trippin [2k\]: "A ko with no ko threats" - redmond
Arcangor [?\]: seki needs shared liberties so no
Becubio [3k\]: LSD is back!!!

BongoBob [-\]: alphago not afraid of ko.
echizenryo [6k\]: gg
BrainCore [3k\]: now b can try to kill the right
BongoBob [-\]: taunting b with ko.
K5 [5k?\]: So was R9 to prepare this as ko aji?
Turnipsi [1k\]: how can the other guy be 3 dan...
lofuchi [3k\]: it doesn't seem to be a sure kill
lofuchi [3k\]: i mean the right
ithisa [25k\]: this is a much more intresting game compared to last 2 tbh
robgv [7k\]: Not a good look on Sedol's face at the moment
TWahl [2k\]: by definition alphago is never afraid of anything...
trippin [2k\]: Turnipsi: he is playing the noob role, for all new people watching
njs [1d\]: he's probably around 3k ish idk
ingen [?\]: Garlock is making up his rank... yea, agreed he cannot be 3d at all
Otniz [6k\]: maybe w will .. tenuki agian ? :)))))
Yubi [?\]: b d3??

godzylla [?\]: b8

esrig [6k\]: yeah, I'm visualizing ... but usually one move short
squid [?\]: AG was in byoyomi in game 2 and while it speeded up the game was not an issue

squid [?\]: I want to know how many CPUs it took to do this

BrainCore [3k\]: cyphase: good point, can deepmind win on bigger boards as well? 
MrM [3k\]: hm
Tictactoe [-\]: i guess i'll stick to my own game, i hardly lose those ^^
ImNoSensei [-\]: squid : apparently they have a 2k computer network
dddwyp [19k\]: AlphaGo win, No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Elios: 3D go 20x20x20
goren22 [2k\]: bye bye 1 million
Madzilla [1d?\]: To be honest, computer evaluation made watching chess more exciting to me, not less...
Cyphase [?\]: depends how much of it is brute-force
feeldabern [4d\]: hard to lose at tic tac toe
miai [1d\]: why resign it's 1 million $$$
ghaele [4d?\]: lee resign
astroJR [4k\]: thx tictactoe
K5 [5k?\]: I suspect, bot much weaker on bigger boards, due to lack of training/joseki...
MrM [3k\]: google should sponsor Sedol with a Basebalbat, so he can smash the goban too mush
kostuek [?\]: about 130 squid, and about 50 gpu
ingen [?\]: is there press conference?
Kael [2d\]: B18 was also brilliant
K5 [5k?\]: But probably not significantly weaker than humans who have similar deficit
lofuchi [3k\]: but humans don't know bigger boards either
BrainCore [3k\]: k5: but the question is if it can be a long term thing. and i don't think it can.
thealphaw: and wnol
lofuchi [3k\]: yes
glasszee [2k\]: gg
njs [1d\]: SCREW U ALPHAGO
ImNoSensei [-\]: oh they're using a reduced version for this?
Codexus [7k?\]: I hope Lee Sedol had not used his 1 million already ;)
squid [?\]: has to be 2,000 or more
ImNoSensei [-\]: my bad
thealphaw: and who else believes the time limit should be lifted ?
squid [?\]: they used 1200 in October
somniferus [14k?\]: how many stone handicap for sedol to win?
miai [1d\]: he haas?? wooow
ausrussell [4k\]: We'll need new rankings 1pc ... pro computer
Ephidel [1k\]: nooooo
Elios: longer time only helps the AI
Elios: shorter would be better
Madzilla [1d?\]: lifting the time limit would probably not help one bit.
Ephidel [1k\]: anything b could have done?
Elios: speed go
BongoBob [-\]: no reason to change the limit in the middle of a match set.
BrainCore [3k\]: ausrussell: yes :D
Hzl [5d?\]: thts sai..
Codexus [7k?\]: they said it's the same hardware, only the software has improved
Elios: 30 sec turns
miai [1d\]: humanity died today
squid [?\]: I think the time needs to be longer
Prodigious [-\]: c11 is the move of the game i guess
MrM [3k\]: 4 hours each seems fair
lofuchi [3k\]: doomsday
weaknoob: 1920 cpus 280 gpus
Ephidel [1k\]: no, time must be shorter
esrig [6k\]: Redmond suggested 5 sec per move
MrM [3k\]: for LSD
Azal [2d\]: o11 is a ko 
Ephidel [1k\]: so human can have a chance
K5 [5k?\]: What is alphago like at blitz?
squid [?\]: thanks weak
Madzilla [1d?\]: They could give Lee a time handicap to make it interesting (i.e. AlphaGo gets 30 minutes and Lee Sedol 2hrs)
Casanova [3d\]: gpu=?
Arcangor [?\]: smartrobot will be angry because he is not the stronget probot anymore
Intagrand [?\]: time won't matter
Elios: K5 much weaker 
miai [1d\]: look how k12 useless is
kookkokf: go processing units
enkarito [?\]: gpu graphic processors
Ephidel [1k\]: what's wrong with e1 for black instead of b5
GreenCoder [7k?\]: gpu = graphics processing unit
Intagrand [?\]: Lee needs stones
squid [?\]: graphics processor = gpu
MrM [3k\]: AG using steady 2/3 minutes for eachs move
Madzilla [1d?\]: actually it doesn't - it has a time management algorithm
K5 [5k?\]: Then the last bastion is 19x19 blitz.
MrM [3k\]: so lifting time would been fair
Codexus [7k?\]: gpu is for graphics normally, but it can be used to do parallel computations very effectively too
weaknoob: though the single computer alpha wins 3 in 10 games against the computer farm version
Casanova [3d\]: why do they need 280 gpu?
USSRMan [3d\]: I cant believe d15 to c11 joseki
Julian1d: Future AlphaGo will figure out what this AlphaGo's flaws are. ;)
Lexical: This tourney is even, to establish who is strongest. And AlphaGo did decide it, convincingly :)
miai [1d\]: 6th line territory.... it's just....
Kael [2d\]: anyone else really want to see what the alpha go vs alpha go games look like?
weaknoob: gpu compute is far more teraflops than the cpus
Cyphase [?\]: Codexus, though these days GPUs are made knowing they'll be used for computation
Julian1d: Yes.
Elios: Cassanova GPUs are really good at lots parallel math
Casanova [3d\]: oh ok
Elios: as long as its simple math
dangerdoom [2k\]: Kael yes yes
Julian1d: "simple" math. :)
USSRMan [3d\]: lee fell completely behind after c11
Cyphase [?\]: Elios, what do you mean, as long as it's simple math?
ArcticDawn [6k\]: This is so sad, lol.
tiki [2k\]: A4
ArcticDawn [6k\]: Only God can beat AlphaGo now :)
K5 [5k?\]: Or maybe a network of 1920 top players, each assigned a different problem via software, that also reconstitutes their moves as a single decision :-)
godzylla [?\]: no i d like to see how alphago win the bottom and eat the g9 group
Madzilla [1d?\]: not branchy math, I guess ;)
Elios: as long as its just an add or mul 
IronCow [2d?\]: is it over? tine? 
Elios: if it has to do a divsion its much slower
ToBeStrong [2k\]: This is not sad it is amazing, stop bashing lee sedol.
IronCow [2d?\]: time?*
Madzilla [1d?\]: not true, Elios
Eternal6k [4k\]: Res
Gims [-\]: IronCow, W+Res
ToBeStrong [2k\]: he played his best and got beat on the board.
jytsao [?\]: lsd played good, b played better
Bellcross [2k?\]: lsd already resigned
jytsao [?\]: i mean w
ArcticDawn [6k\]: yeah it is over
pCeitin [2k\]: I don't think this is sad, I think it rekindled my long dead passion for go
weaknoob: Glad he didn't quite and played it out looking for weaknesses and had a big ko fight
weaknoob: c1 was amazing
