njs [1d\]: live
BobWhoosta [2d\]: pony, it had to calculate the yose.  Difficult.
Zaid [7k\]: AlphaGo learns from a base record of human games, so it should play more human like
tontonken [2k\]: 4-4 next, very orthodox
leachy [2k\]: some guy sitting there with a computer monitor and mouse to input and relay teh moves

begin [?\]: i like lee sedol win but i think alpha will win
BobWhoosta [2d\]: I'm thinking F17.
tsutsumi [14k?\]: probably
adamb1: why are they taking so long at the beginning?
rsun [-\]: f17 or p17 are most likely for lee
kadoban [?\]: Moose: haven't paid too much attention to current events, eh? :)
Falcon89 [5k\]: Moose, Alphago is a Google bot
shashwat [7k?\]: Alpha Go is demonstrably 2p+
masek [?\]: Who plays black? 
hurluberlu [3k\]: good game so far
Tictactoe [-\]: Knowing Lee he would f17 or o17
drwhois [2k\]: f17
Parklane [7k?\]: lee sedol black
]
;B[fc]C[drwhois [2k\]: is played
ATG [4k\]: lee attacks!
Deft1 [5k\]: pros often take a long time on opening moves
Falcon89 [5k\]: Sedol  is black
Moose [2d\]: i have, just being sarcastic ;)
drwhois [2k\]: lee sedol doesnt want passive game
kdbaby14 [6k\]: he attacks
leachy [2k\]: bobwhoosta wins
Jsnake [?\]: You'd think Lee would have responses to these moves already decided
drwhois [2k\]: in stream, is it redmond commenting?
Trevoke [?\]: drwhois : yes
kadoban [?\]: Yes, that's redmond
Moose [2d\]: so the live stream is really delayed?
edlee [2k\]: Thanks
KobeGote [6k?\]: Lee just finished a tournamnet, I wonder how much time he's actually thought about this match
LordVader [1k\]: at least here there's playing, wbaduk hasn't started broadcasting, and redmond is just chitchatting as if he didn't notice that the game started.
papapishu [1d\]: p16 
Moose [2d\]: i'm still seeing a countdown on the youtube stream

Deft1 [5k\]: I like the asymetry of Lee's stones
cekalo [1k\]: wow thats passive
JohnNothaf [23k\]: if you are still seeing a coutn own refresh your pbrowser
shinigami [?\]: does alphago follow the big moyo-like styles of its brothers?
hurluberlu [3k\]: M17 !
leachy [2k\]: probably m17
BobWhoosta [2d\]: M17 is in fashion.
KobeGote [6k?\]: Do commentators always wait this long to use the magnetic board?
easyrobot [2k\]: hope that alphago won't play kind of bug move
Onirik [3d\]: If you lag close the youtube chat mb
njs [1d\]: m17 seems logical
njs [1d\]: right
edlee [2k\]: Kobe -- it's their mood
TheWolf [2d\]: OMG it has begun!
kadoban [?\]: Yeah, there's not a ton of point until there's a few moves
rsun [-\]: wow
Jermelle [?\]: m17 next
Tictactoe [-\]: Normally they start half an hour after the start of the match to show some basic patterns
fldkg: c18

Jermelle [?\]: woah... r8
julbla [4k\]: r8
heather [1k\]: anti-bot strategy = lose
hurluberlu [3k\]: son't K2
Moose [2d\]: he's trying to play something alphago never seen before I guess
drwhois [2k\]: lee sedol is shaking?
njs [1d\]: m17 i thought is better than r8
BobWhoosta [2d\]: Nice, now we're going to see this wonky Chinese in all professional games.
awesome [3k\]: very strange to play low on the right side
cdocdo [2k\]: r8
ATG [4k\]: yo alphago not gonna know that micro chinese
Jermelle [?\]: BobWhoosta [2d\]: Nice, now we're going to see this wonky Chinese in all professional games.

hurluberlu [3k\]: wow
hurluberlu [3k\]: faszt
masek [?\]: In China now lunch time
H16 [3d\]: Is it only me or is the youtube feed overloaded and difficult to watch?
TheWolf [2d\]: r8 huh?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: alphago takes the same amount of time
Jermelle [?\]: I think the bot picked r8 as a mistake
Jermelle [?\]: I certainly didn't expect r8
cjb: has Lee played R8 before?
masek [?\]: Having lunch and  watching this game 
playful [?\]: is there a way to watch the broadcast in China without youtube?
Onirik [3d\]: H16:try to close youtube chat
Jsnake [?\]: YouTube fine in real time
playful [?\]: please!
TheWolf [2d\]: can we watch this live on youtube?
Trevoke [?\]: Jermelle : B is Lee Sedol
TheWolf [2d\]: link?
hurluberlu [3k\]: crazy already
Trevoke [?\]: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=vFr3K2DORc8
painful [2d\]: i m in china,i m having lunch
Tristero [1d\]: I also had problems with firefox -use chrome
TheWolf [2d\]: thanks
rsun [-\]: p16 is a great move
MiAnLien [6k\]: M16 is good
Jermelle [?\]: I know, it responded so fast because r8 might have been a mistake in it's eyes XD
masek [?\]: In China YouTube not would
santiago [2d\]: high level commentary by michael
Moose [2d\]: poor Michael Redmond having to explain why moves are played in the corner
drwhois [2k\]: who is the another man in the video? 
Jermelle [?\]: It's never played
masek [?\]: Works 
juhop [1d\]: alphago seems unfazed by the trick :)
ATG [4k\]: funny watching 9p trying to explain go for people whos never played
kdbaby14 [6k\]: lol
drwhois [2k\]: the man in the left never played go
shashwat [7k?\]: m16
BobWhoosta [2d\]: I like M16.
Jermelle [?\]: n17 next
]
;B[ld]C[Zaid [7k\]: The other man is the editor of the AGA ejournal
groobiest: that's stupid, why not give pro commentary?
Zaid [7k\]: So I think he knows how to play Go
kadoban [?\]: Garlock is fairly strong amateur
Moose [2d\]: why is someone who never played commenting?
drwhois [2k\]: i feel sad
njs [1d\]: TAISHa pls
Zaid [7k\]: They're explaining it for viewers who have never played before
hurluberlu [3k\]: expected
Kashomon [2k?\]: about 5 dan
Trevoke [?\]: As the game progresses, there will be significantly more complex commentary.
shashwat [7k?\]: alpha go attacks
]
;W[qc]C[shashwat [7k?\]: r17
rsun [-\]: alphago is giving me goosebumps already
H16 [3d\]: closed chat and it goes fluently
aitkensam [-\]: r17 isnt bad?
]
;B[rc]C[drwhois [2k\]: alphago looks better imho
rsun [-\]: r17 is taboo in textbooks
hurluberlu [3k\]: wait
Falcon89 [5k\]: Chris Garlock relayed many tourny games for us here 
playful [?\]: any broadcast available in China?
gogonuts [4d\]: r17 not so good
ATG [4k\]: just waiting for AGA stream to go up Myungwan commentary!
playful [?\]: please
Eggplant [2d\]: strange
drwhois [2k\]: rsun, really
Moose [2d\]: so many pictures being taken of the reviewers
Tictactoe [-\]: it gets easier to estimate the distances now, as i hardly can make out the hoshi on the youtube board
kdbaby14 [6k\]: R-17 is not really well developed
rsun [-\]: r17 is not playable with m16
hurluberlu [3k\]: w hasn't Q17 yet
OddKibitz [2d\]: yeah r17 not recommended
Jsnake [?\]: Watch.. R8 is going to be the move that wins or loses this thing
leachy [2k\]: eh? attach under? what happened to the bot's pattern recognition bit?
longbaby [?\]: really? r17 a taboo?
rsun [-\]: at least according to our current knowledge
Falcon89 [5k\]: plainful, i don't think so
]
;W[pc]C[drwhois [2k\]: hm, if thats real, the bot is gonna lose that afst
rsun [-\]: unless alphago shows up sth brilliant that we all missed
hurluberlu [3k\]: ok
drwhois [2k\]: haha rsun, new joseki invented
MiAnLien [6k\]: joseki no good for white
amadis [4k\]: it's good to hear michael redmond comment. a 9p who is a native english speaker, luxurious
Reym [-\]: lee tries to unsettle alphago by playing the sequences with a different order
hurluberlu [3k\]: sad
painful [2d\]: it s joseki
longbaby [?\]: a machine wouldn't feel painful
]
;B[re]C[hurluberlu [3k\]: not joseki
Reym [-\]: but it's image recognition so if it ends the same it won't help
njs [1d\]: lee has more TIME THAN alphago HAHA
drwhois [2k\]: i can't believe, redmond is explaining to a 30kyu
eatramen [?\]: that's good, a lot of 30 kyus are watching
zaphod [4k\]: kgs cant find a decent commentator?
bert [?\]: go human go
H16 [3d\]: r8 also unorthodox, Lee is messing wwhit alphago allready....
drwhois [2k\]: eatramen, good and bad at same time
sunki [?\]: they're playing fast
kdbaby14 [6k\]: P-14 is good
Tictactoe [-\]: Tictactoe commented over one hundred games in his lifetime
bert [?\]: make the bot scream in pain and blush with embarassement
Trevoke [?\]: W P14
leachy [2k\]: a good idea to explain to beginners so that they'll watch the rest and feel it's understandable and get interested in playing
kadoban [?\]: AGA stream is supposed to start later with another commentator, probably more geared towards in-depth go comments

;W[of]
;B[pg]C[okc0nde: j16?
gogonuts [4d\]: r8 was the only b curveball
sykta: this is a crazy opening
Gon [1d\]: KADOBAN
gogonuts [4d\]: strange ur is alphas doing
hurluberlu [3k\]: happy move for b
Epsilion [4k\]: sedol seems to be playing quickly
hurluberlu [3k\]: R8 ideal
leachy [2k\]: white needs some magic somewhere on the top otherwise white is well behind
painful [2d\]: J16
heather [1k\]: redmond is a great commentator from what I've seen, I hope he makes this a usual commentary and leaves the AGA guy for more beginner stuff
pony16 [4k\]: any links to advanced english commentary?
Tristero [1d\]: good for b
rsun [-\]: alpha probably discovered sth we don't know, gogo
Marathon [6k?\]: why is the right side of chat cut off, with no scroll bar?
kadoban [?\]: Gon: Haha ... n2?
Gon [1d\]: haha, sure thing
kadoban [?\]: Nice!
skillup [5d\]: w will go j16
feeldabern [4d\]: white joseki in upper right is usually called as classic white mistake
Gon [1d\]: ...don't tell anyone haha
]
;W[og]C[BobWhoosta [2d\]: This is nice for black imo.
gogonuts [4d\]: w needs to avoid b j16 imo
drwhois [2k\]: alphago new joseki!!!
kadoban [?\]: I shall keep your secret ;)
feeldabern [4d\]: but it's not so bad globally
H16 [3d\]: pushing from behind
H16 [3d\]: reallly?
heather [1k\]: counter pincer incoming
santiago [2d\]: michael trying hard not to use japanese jargon
cxcv: R17 is a bad move, according to 羅洗河9P...
rsun [-\]: w is definitely aiming at the kick and pincer
painful [2d\]: new joseki
zaphod [4k\]: p13 kyu move
Moose [2d\]: alpha is reinventing the go proverbs
Tictactoe [-\]: first daring move by alphago, pushing black over the line of victory 4th line
Zonked [2d\]: feels crude..
njs [1d\]: white aiming for k16
]
;B[ph]C[BobWhoosta [2d\]: Yeah, I like that santiago, he's allowing the possibility of new players.
feeldabern [4d\]: if w doesn't exchange r17, b wouldn't be able to go to q13
gogonuts [4d\]: i think no kick
kadoban [?\]: This looks pretty good for black at least on the right, r8 looks like a success so far?
leachy [2k\]: if white loses badly, i wonder if anyone will claim it's joseki now
BobWhoosta [2d\]: This flow feels so nice for black.
gogonuts [4d\]: kick might lose the invasion
Trevoke [?\]: M16 weakened a bit
DarkRaist [3k\]: woah white is giving away a lot up front?
kdbaby14 [6k\]: B look so good
Jermelle [?\]: It's probably going to play k16 or h17 
DarkRaist [3k\]: would love to see lee sedols face
BobWhoosta [2d\]: M16 couldn't be in a better spot.
DarkRaist [3k\]: at this point
hurluberlu [3k\]: good for b
DarkRaist [3k\]: when white pushed
rsun [-\]: I admire redmond's clarity
BobWhoosta [2d\]: rsun, same here.
sykta: arent they playing super fast ?
Tictactoe [-\]: k16 expected now
itsurmove [1k\]: b resigns
Sez [12k\]: r17 is a good move according to xuzglidutdfgg.com
njs [1d\]: ^
adoreme [2d\]: 65000 viewers in the stream
njs [1d\]: I mean ^ rusun
leachy [2k\]: fan hui will claim he played the stronger version
Deft1 [5k\]: did r17 lose the game already? w seems very heavy
superpal1 [1d\]: time to cut the pieces
eatramen [?\]: any links for chinese commentary?
gogonuts [4d\]: redmond is offtrack with "outside database" though
zaphod [4k\]: redmond thinks alpha has a database :)
rsun [-\]: j16 marks the end of fuseki!
kdbaby14 [6k\]: W-J16 next
sykta: here it comes
heather [1k\]: I think lee expects bot's passive style will compromise too much
feeldabern [4d\]: alpha might have a database
]
;W[id]C[Jermelle [?\]: j16
feeldabern [4d\]: we don't know
gogonuts [4d\]: it just doesnt use an explicit opening database#
zaphod [4k\]: it doesnt
njs [1d\]: j16
kadoban [?\]: If nothing else it does have a training set, which is ... a little like a database.
Kashomon [2k?\]: correct, it does not
rsun [-\]: gogo would you kick first here
njs [1d\]: black in trouble
njs [1d\]: hahaa
sykta: fight on move 18
royu [4d\]: gg, leesedol resigns
Jermelle [?\]: The fight starts already?
Zonked [2d\]: well, in some ways, neural network does encode fuseki, so you could argue it has a database
drwhois [2k\]: omg, lee sedol is behind
Iniesta [3k\]: fight
feeldabern [4d\]: probably it doesn't ^^ but if it was having trouble in opening they might have added a database
Moose [2d\]: wow, alphago wins in 18 moves
zaphod [4k\]: its clear redmond hasntt read anything about alpha
njs [1d\]: Resign Lee sedol
njs [1d\]: you already losing :P
zavion [2k\]: is there an AGA stream with myungwan kim ?
jellyroll: haha... comments so funny....
H16 [3d\]: If Leesedol loses to this...
Trevoke [?\]: Why so much sarcasm, folks?
azblueeyes [8k\]: not yet
kadoban [?\]: zavion: Yeah, but I don't think it's starting until later.
Zonked [2d\]: zavion, later
Fumbar [17k\]: not until later i believe
Tictactoe [-\]: check usgo.org 
azblueeyes [8k\]: aga site not up yet
drwhois [2k\]: black = 2 weak groups
Azal [2d\]: online steam with good comments ??
zavion [2k\]: cool thx :)
superpal1 [1d\]: lee can easily handle this
Tristero [1d\]: myungwan will comment game 3
gogonuts [4d\]: d17?
njs [1d\]: nah
hurluberlu [3k\]: this is pretty textbook
Zonked [2d\]: j16 looks like good fighting spirit tho
zaphod [4k\]: huge fight coming
njs [1d\]: lee has to take his time
Parklane [7k?\]: no dtabase in the nature article but it two neural nets (value estimation and move estimation) and in those nets the coefficients were trained on databases (of external games and games against itself)
njs [1d\]: otherwise he'kk go rando
Azal [2d\]: yeah.. big fight
okc0nde: idk why but i thing we can read some move of alphago but hard for read lee sedol move :)
adfafdsfaf: Andrew Jackson said AGA would be delayed about 30 minutes at least.
Tictactoe [-\]: i am amazed by the vulcan sedol hairstyle
Zonked [2d\]: k17 instead of j16 would be softer? this is more attack oriented
TheWolf [2d\]: he played m14 
royu [4d\]: myungwan is holding a viewing party in LA I believe?
]
;B[lf]C[drwhois [2k\]: where can i find another commentaries?
rsun [-\]: will alpha push once more?
LordVader [1k\]: here I was hoping Michael Redmond would actually just talk about the game ...
drwhois [2k\]: in youtube
milkmilks: nullify the wall! 
azblueeyes [8k\]: It is traditional to say resign early and often in gokgs kibbutz
longbaby [?\]: does Lee take the opponent as a machine or a human?
Tristero [1d\]: w will be destroyed ...
ATG [4k\]: AGA said they starting their stream an hour after game starts
njs [1d\]: m12
Xombar [2d?\]: https://www.twitch.tv/usgoweb or https://www.youtube.com/user/USGOWeb/featured will start commentary after an hour I heard
zaphod [4k\]: redmond is doing a good job of explaining the game to non players
kdbaby14 [6k\]: B is still strong
kadoban [?\]: LordVader: As it goes on I'm sure he will. At the beginning they need to wait for more stuff to talk about anyway.
rsun [-\]: bingo
Deft1 [5k\]: "it's a battle, and now they're tearing hair, there's hair all over the place, there's hair all over the board, I don't know who's hair it is..... it's mine.  And there goes the winner!"

Jermelle [?\]: This is painful'
Moose [2d\]: the youtube stream is really delayed for me

;B[pi]C[kdbaby14 [6k\]: this is nice
delinda [1d\]: Can AlphaGo resign, or will it keep playing to the end no matter what?
Long [?\]: alphago is 13p lol
OddKibitz [2d\]: dunno, after this, I would say this is hopeless for W
Jermelle [?\]: m16 and f17 ain't looking good...
Ube [-\]: that is a lot of cash
Tictactoe [-\]: Alphago has no official ranking
leachy [2k\]: if white was a random player off the street, lee sedol would stop the game right now and teach w the theory of why this is really bad
LordVader [1k\]: aha, now he's talking :)
crate: game wrongly upset by komi
rsun [-\]: I know alphago very well
]
;W[lh]C[njs [1d\]: Lee playig so fast
njs [1d\]: did he already read out the whole game lol
TheWolf [2d\]: actually alphago used more of its time
julbla [4k\]: l12
zampa [-\]: he read it out and sai wins by 0.5p
njs [1d\]: l12
reyreyc: lee sedol wanted to fight
Long [?\]: alphago is sai 
Tictactoe [-\]: i think it's normal for Lee to play these logical moves fastly

;B[kh]C[reyreyc: now he is happy
Jermelle [?\]: woah.
bryamatt [12k\]: its an intimidation tactic. make alphago play quicker and make mistakes
eatramen [?\]: alphago is huang longshi?
kadoban [?\]: I haven't seen too many of his games live, but doesn't he always kind of hurry a bit through opening? I think I remember reading he just likes to get to middle game.
okc0nde: like l13
escudero [3k\]: I like this for black
sykta: b is already ahead
julbla [4k\]: l15
]
;W[ke]C[Iniesta [3k\]: push on the 4th line looks weird
Long [?\]: sai came back in alphago lol
njs [1d\]: Lee Sedol already read out the entire game. Lee + 12.5
Zonked [2d\]: I wish they would have alphago commenting the game too
Jermelle [?\]: oooo
gogonuts [4d\]: uh oh
drwhois [2k\]: this is a hard fight
rsun [-\]: alphago is getting it
Jermelle [?\]: this is gonna be insane
heather [1k\]: oh boy w prepping l13 
hurluberlu [3k\]: this is a simple fight for b
Trevoke [?\]: kadoban : Redmond said that like .. 10 minutes ago :)
Tictactoe [-\]: aja huang never played this strongly before
Sweetrip [9d\]: oh my god
drwhois [2k\]: rsun, do u prefer alphago or lee now?
Sweetrip [9d\]: the speed at which alphago played l15
kadoban [?\]: Oh haha XD
Sweetrip [9d\]: incredible
Jermelle [?\]: ^
Jermelle [?\]: It's over
TheWolf [2d\]: Sweetrip we expect your comments
escudero [3k\]: let the fireworks start

Sweetrip [9d\]: im terrified
Eggplant [2d\]: :)
Sweetrip [9d\]: that move
skillup [5d\]: we all expect your comment :)
drwhois [2k\]: sweetrip, please tell about the move
Jermelle [?\]: I'm too concerned
Zonked [2d\]: sweetrip, but its somewehat natural, no?
Sweetrip [9d\]: top pros
Lilou [1d\]: L15 in his mind was like: TO-BI !
zaphod [4k\]: please can everyone else shut uop and we listen to sweetrip
drwhois [2k\]: oooo
Sweetrip [9d\]: cant play those kind of moves consistently
okc0nde: yup nice move l15
rsun [-\]: K15 is the best thing b can do
Sweetrip [9d\]: in blitz
Zonked [2d\]: I guess google invested some in timemanagement, unlike other bots
drwhois [2k\]: sweetrip, please keep comenting, we have no more 9dans :(
Tictactoe [-\]: If we keep the kyu-players to ask questions, the top-dan might attempt to answer them to clarify
Sweetrip [9d\]: and im guessing alphago already read out the semeai
drwhois [2k\]: hmmm
njs [1d\]: l15 is awesome
groobiest: So, Redmond saying that R17 is not a great move?
Sweetrip [9d\]: since l15 is a do or die move
probe [-\]: the what now?
drwhois [2k\]: now im getting scaried
itsurmove [1k\]: b colapse
fanweiqi [8d\]: alphago!
njs [1d\]: hey sweetrip can you live commentate with voice plsss
kdbaby14 [6k\]: B need to connect
Anatoly [2d?\]: b colapse..
Uberdude [2d\]: l12 was a bluff?
leachy [2k\]: the bot can't read out the semeai....only can get a probabilistic result based on monte carlo search
Lilou [1d\]: do y all feel the little thing in ur stomach saying gloups 
eatramen [?\]: im not scared, lee is plenty strong enough... lee please
Zonked [2d\]: leachy, neural network part might be able to actually read out semeais
Sez [12k\]: hm b l13?
DarkRaist [3k\]: two violations of proverb in a row
Sweetrip [9d\]: white is leadin
DarkRaist [3k\]: excellent!
Jermelle [?\]: I'm sweating for lee sedol. l15 was genius and he played it that quickly
reyreyc: very interesit
Sweetrip [9d\]: in my opinion
herbert [10k?\]: Good sugestion tictactoe
drwhois [2k\]: 9dan saying L15 is amazing... now i feel scaried for real
rsun [-\]: Lee says, "smoke, no joke"
leachy [2k\]: it uses monte carlo random search together with a neural net pattern matching algorithm
Jermelle [?\]: *it played it quickly
reyreyc: very interesting what you sy sweetrip
okc0nde: i think lee sedol is worry right now
Zonked [2d\]: as in neural network could get the answer "do I win the semeai" correctly and consistently
shashwat [7k?\]: m15
]
;B[le]C[KobeGote [6k?\]: Hm... Lee thought long and hard, but ultimately responds to the peep
njs [1d\]: Is lee worried now
Nick23 [1d\]: AlphaGo doesn't have the same problems with Ko and Semeai as other bots. It can read them out correctly.
Sweetrip [9d\]: m13
rsun [-\]: bump
drwhois [2k\]: i want to see lee face
TheWolf [2d\]: he never looks worried
leachy [2k\]: but you can't answer that question, zonked...certainly not using those methods
okc0nde: m13 really
kadoban [?\]: Anyone else getting pretty laggy youtube stream?
TheWolf [2d\]: he's just sipping his tea
hurluberlu [3k\]: this w engine is overfitted
Lilou [1d\]: www.leeface.com
leachy [2k\]: you can get a probabilistic idea only
hurluberlu [3k\]: i wouldn't worry
Moose [2d\]: kadoban - YES
DarkRaist [3k\]: Was so hoping he'd ignore the peek
allmustdie [2k\]: drwhois , here you can see lee face
KobeGote [6k?\]: Cross cut <30 moves?
Sweetrip [9d\]: lee sedol
allmustdie [2k\]: http://www.zhanqi.tv/8888
jellyroll: feel like b got nice profit *and* neutralized w wall....
Sweetrip [9d\]: needs to take more time
crate: talking tennis  ko lol
zaphod [4k\]: kgs needs two chat windows, one for expert commentary and another for all the trolls
julbla [4k\]: m13
okc0nde: m13 l14  k15 ?
rsun [-\]: L14 only move
santiago [2d\]: deepmind should ask boston dynamics to build them a go playing robot
julbla [4k\]: alphago plays m13
Zonked [2d\]: leacy, deep NN should be able to mimic semeai reading
skillup [5d\]: w played m13
Parklane [7k?\]: @zaphod good idea
r0n1n [2d\]: w played m13

;W[lg]C[hurluberlu [3k\]: incredible
itsurmove [1k\]: m3 is must
Lilou [1d\]: ^^
heather [1k\]: exciting already
njs [1d\]: Lee Sedol is feeling the bern!
Blitzbold [1d?\]: alphago playing more vulgar than any human :)
heather [1k\]: r8 strategy busted, humans are over
fanweiqi [8d\]: so exciting
rsun [-\]: looking back, it's as if alpha knew b would play q13, so it could push all the way to get m12
eatramen [?\]: @allmustdie thanks 
hurluberlu [3k\]: what amove
leachy [2k\]: mimic in some sense, but it's not the same as reading or knowing 
groobiest: Well, I had to mute the YouTube commentary
rsun [-\]: if that were true, that would be really scary
kadoban [?\]: Woh m13
Azal [2d\]: L12 bad move 
OddKibitz [2d\]: amazimg
Azal [2d\]: ?
Moose [2d\]: L14
njs [1d\]: l12 literally
njs [1d\]: wasted
njs [1d\]: Ouch
zeven [?\]: What is going on with this useless Michael Redmond commentary?
okc0nde: alphago waiting for b's wrong move
rsun [-\]: it's a trade
hurluberlu [3k\]: b is not happy
TheWolf [2d\]: koreans are trolling the chat so badly on youtube
rsun [-\]: w gets the outside 
njs [1d\]: its a bad trade for b
TheWolf [2d\]: chat got very intermittent bc of that
gogonuts [4d\]: worrysome that b is hesitating on L14
kdbaby14 [6k\]: O-15?
Deft1 [5k\]: what are b's options, l14?
santiago [2d\]: he's talking about ke jie?
longbaby [?\]: what will be the next move?
hurluberlu [3k\]: yes
shashwat [7k?\]: i think the spectacled dude is distracting redmond. redmond wants to discuss the match
Moose [2d\]: i think the only move is L14, but I'm not Lee Sedol
kdbaby14 [6k\]: I was thinking O-15
julbla [4k\]: seems michael explains for beginners
okc0nde: o15 dosen't work
zeven [?\]: L14 is so painful
DarkRaist [3k\]: L14 is totally the move
njs [1d\]: Sweetrip what do you think
rsun [-\]: now alpha is winning on time
RoadHobo [6k\]: you would think he'd learn the names of the top players for a job commenting
longbaby [?\]: l14
Azal [2d\]: no change for L13?
superpal1 [1d\]: this seems hard for b
DarkRaist [3k\]: pushing from behind seems somewhat reasoanble now
jellyroll: k16?
twoody [3k\]: Lee's face had become noticeably more red since this turn started
zavion [2k\]: so exciting already
elsky [2d\]: why L14 painfull? looks od
LordVader [1k\]: actually wbaduk pros predicted m13
Zonked [2d\]: juble, even if its aimed at beginners, he will inevitably slip and reveal some gems
Bahji [4k\]: who is commenting ?
LordVader [1k\]: it's not so surprising
skillup [5d\]: we need sweetrip and fanweiqi's comments :)
Kashomon [2k?\]: Michael Redmond
amadis [4k\]: i love that a 9p is making it understandable for noobs. i think that's great. very hard to do!
zavion [2k\]: michael richmond 9p
Bahji [4k\]: ty
GoRoGoRo [7k?\]: nice: rsun [-\]: now alpha is winning on time
twoody [3k\]: Is Lee breathing :o
Moose [2d\]: funny Michael Redmond couldn't pronounce Ke Jie
crate: time and komi of 7. anything have no place in this match :(
longbaby [?\]: why no third-party supervise this game? only google controls everything
LordVader [1k\]: but they didn't expect l13
julbla [4k\]: l13
rsun [-\]: o.o

;B[kg]C[Dalan [-\]: his japanese is flawless though.
rsun [-\]: this may be a short game...
cjb: boooom
njs [1d\]: l13!?!?1
KobeGote [6k?\]: Score Estimate is taking its fellow computer's side and says white is winning
gogonuts [4d\]: holy moly
leachy [2k\]: the 'k' is just aspirated 'k' is enough
hurluberlu [3k\]: lol
glousse: who is playing for alphago ?
santiago [2d\]: danger
Ube [-\]: whoaaaaa

itsurmove [1k\]: b loses
okc0nde: next b o15?
gogonuts [4d\]: damn :-)
hurluberlu [3k\]: expected
hurluberlu [3k\]: from YiSeTol
njs [1d\]: Yeah maybe give control to sweetrip lol
Lilou [1d\]: b live 
tp1024 [-\]: b can't really sacrifice those three stones, can he?
DarkRaist [3k\]: what is the sequence?
probe [-\]: black sacrifices and expect to make up for it?
DarkRaist [3k\]: how doe black live after this?
santiago [2d\]: k17 after m11 i guess
fanweiqi [8d\]: wow
julbla [4k\]: cut
zeven [?\]: This game could end quickly?
feeldabern [4d\]: b can live with the 3 stones but...
leachy [2k\]: i'm sure lee planned this one but the bot didn't
H16 [3d\]: so b lives inside is allright?
julbla [4k\]: o15
longbaby [?\]: l13 is bad
njs [1d\]: l13 might be the losing move
rsun [-\]: living inside is usually bad
USSRMan [3d\]: I bet alphago will l14
r0n1n [2d\]: looks like he read something, instead of us
julbla [4k\]: l14 o15
shashwat [7k?\]: b is attacking
hurluberlu [3k\]: sacrifice
adfafdsfaf: l14 already played
Moose [2d\]: Lee wants to prove his leading is better than a computer
julbla [4k\]: that's the game
royu [4d\]: Fan Hui laughing 
Lilou [1d\]: problem is : hard to think the bot didnt expected a move from b...
okc0nde: better than l14 i think
Moose [2d\]: his reading*
ccsco [1k\]: how can you say L13 is bad?
Hollowb55 [11k\]: Feel free to clone the game and run another comment board if you want to. xD
julbla [4k\]: l14 o15
TheWolf [2d\]: alphago already cut a min ago, get a move on tictactoe!
rubicon [-\]: l14 k17 j17 j18 possibly?

;W[kf]C[feeldabern [4d\]: even if you play o15 it doesn't do much good
Sweetrip [9d\]: lee is playing too fast
adfafdsfaf: o15
Blitzbold [1d?\]: l14, & o15 played
GoRoGoRo [7k?\]: wow
Sweetrip [9d\]: he needs to spend more time reading, or maybe he read everything out
njs [1d\]: o15
okc0nde: cause l13 can save f18
Sweetrip [9d\]: then i take it back
julbla [4k\]: o15 p15 played
longbaby [?\]: Fan Hui has been bought by google, I am sure
Moose [2d\]: tictactoe probably has a laggy stream too

;B[jc]C[rsun [-\]: unless he push cuts somehow
okc0nde: yup
Jermelle [?\]: mm
Azal [2d\]: mmm does not seems good for black
hondra [1d?\]: Fan wasn't bought, he was hired. Not by Google directly, but by the Deepmind team.
fanweiqi [8d\]: I just bet 45million tygem dollars on Alphago!
eatramen [?\]: game 1 might be a testing game for lee
Moose [2d\]: this just looks really bad for black imo
hurluberlu [3k\]: pushing from behind was not good either from w
okc0nde: now f18 is suppost
hurluberlu [3k\]: who got more ?
leachy [2k\]: i think lee already knows this shape
TheWolf [2d\]: hey fanweiqi!
longbaby [?\]: ok

rsun [-\]: b needs myoshu to turn this over
longbaby [?\]: wow w plays like a human
Koons [?\]: Ke Jie just said that black overplayed
drwhois [2k\]: this left man in video seems good for first time about go
Sweetrip [9d\]: if black cant cut
rsun [-\]: b cannot just merely make 2 eyes, that would be the same as resigning the game
Eggplant [2d\]: its not his first time
Trevoke [?\]: drwhois : he's played Go for years
Sweetrip [9d\]: he is then behind
buhaypa [3k\]: That's Chris Garlock
Jermelle [?\]: k15 
Jsnake [?\]: This is crazy. Why would b overplay in first game?
shinigami [?\]: cause he's lee sedol
DemonStyle [3d?\]: That's Chris Garlock. He runs the AGA E-Journal
drwhois [2k\]: sorry, who is Chris Garlock ?
buhaypa [3k\]: He edits the AGA e journal 
longbaby [?\]: a machines doesn't know what is overplay
Deft1 [5k\]: living here seems like it will be risky for f17
zavion [2k\]: k17 after l13 doesnt seem right to me
Sweetrip [9d\]: drwhois, where is ke jie commentating?
skillup [5d\]: it looks really good for white
TheWolf [2d\]: so everybody agrees l12 was overplay?
okc0nde: k15 l16?
hurluberlu [3k\]: he's not
SharkPro [6k\]: ke jie is commenting on chinese streaming site
gogonuts [4d\]: lee sedol will show more respect in game 2 ...
herbert [10k?\]: quick question, why is the lives stream using an English Board (with an i)?
drwhois [2k\]: ke jie? who said it
USSRMan [3d\]: outread a bot that can read 200m moves per second?
ccsco [1k\]: maybe you can play where you like when you're LSD
drwhois [2k\]: wait...
Zonked [2d\]: ussrman, alphago doesnt read all that fast, actually rather slow at reading
Tristero [1d\]: lee can read 30 moves/sec
rsun [-\]: I feel like lee underestimated the bot after it played r17
okc0nde: k16
USSRMan [3d\]: deepblue can do 200m/s so I just assumed
guesty: go on lsd is a brilliant idea  
playtoe [?\]: why can't i watch the order of moves?
shinigami [?\]: you have to clone the game to replay it
njs [1d\]: You have to clone the game
USSRMan [3d\]: how fast can alphago read?
hurluberlu [3k\]: clone 
okc0nde: k16 l16 l17 k15
njs [1d\]: Then you can see the order of the moves

;B[jd]C[sagesse [-\]: k16 
c137: its running off 10,000 cores so it shoul be fairly quick
skillup [5d\]: go cut?
omggg [2k?\]: playtoe, Options, view offline
longbaby [?\]: they should mark the number of the move on the stone
Sweetrip [9d\]: i see black's plan
Zonked [2d\]: ya, huge number of cores sure helps, but its slower per core than any other bot
Blitzbold [1d?\]: alphago doesnt "read" the way u seem to imagine
fldkg: ?
shinigami [?\]: what is his plan sweetrip
Koons [?\]: ke jie likes white's position
njs [1d\]: what is it sweetrip
hurluberlu [3k\]: O15 important
kadoban [?\]: Blitzbold: Wellll ... it does something actually pretty close to reading I think.
Zonked [2d\]: blitzbold, sure it does, it actually reads in a very human way, deciding how deep it should be reading based on how the result looks
c137: He plans to win 4-1 instead of 5-0 ;p

;W[ie]C[Deft1 [5k\]: cut the j16 and l15 groups?

hondra [1d?\]: w looks massively better

cekalo [1k\]: F17 looks so alone

hurluberlu [3k\]: looks like a punish diagram from textbook
Anatoly [2d?\]: I like w in this position
njs [1d\]: k15
tp1024 [-\]: that move 24, at l15, really looked like a wakeup call for lee sedol ... it looks much more tense since that and he also started to take much more time
electron [6d\]: possible for b to make j18 h18 h17 to work somehow?
hurluberlu [3k\]: but, O15 is here
LordVader [1k\]: yes, this looks difficult for black
USSRMan [3d\]: black looks too weak to k15, k14, j14
njs [1d\]: How would that work electron
zavion [2k\]: its impossible that lee sedol didnt see this position coming, but it doesnt look good, so why choose it?
H16 [3d\]: Michael Redmond sound kinda like Morgan Freemon
USSRMan [3d\]: l13 stones hard to manage
Kettu [5d\]: all the stress would be on black anyway, since white is on the outside
longbaby [?\]: really looks like a game by a robot
Kettu [5d\]: even if there was potential stress
Ahamay [7d?\]: Wonder when the AGA's stream will go live..
njs [1d\]: Black is getting surrounded
royu [4d\]: w looks stronger to me too 
Long [?\]: this look very bad for b

leachy [2k\]: hmm looks like a good exchange actually (m11 n11 )
hurluberlu [3k\]: yup
hondra [1d?\]: when moves are forcing, play is fast

twoody [3k\]: ....
replicator [2d\]: IMpossible to talk about basics during this game
glasszee [2k\]: leachy, advanced commentary begins in 8 mintues
manta [3d\]: thank god redmond is here to tell about liberties
glasszee [2k\]: on USGO stream
replicator [2d\]: seems very out of place

cekalo [1k\]: alpha is so fast
fanweiqi [8d\]: oh boy
hondra [1d?\]: who would want a machine ref at the ufc...
r0n1n [2d\]: i didn'y actually call it, but saw it on the stream
Jsnake [?\]: N18 too passive?
rsun [-\]: I think this whole thing only makes sense if b has a kami no itte
adfafdsfaf: G16 was natural though. not hard for white.
manta [3d\]: so b needs to connect l11 now?
alphago91: Wishing there was an advanced commentary stream. Why did they pay another 9d to give simple commentary?
Ukasuhs [?\]: i guess b has to save l12 stones then
longbaby [?\]: alpha is too quick to be true
Long [?\]: alphago is kami no itte
Jermelle [?\]: Lee is making this more complex than it has to be
Jermelle [?\]: l11 
hurluberlu [3k\]: F17 is misplaced now
hondra [1d?\]: n18 prevents m16 from getting captured
gogonuts [4d\]: b outplayed
kadoban [?\]: There is going to be another commentary by kim 9d on the AGA stream eventually, pretty soon I think.
rsun [-\]: the simple commentary only occurs at the beginning
Reym [-\]: i'm worried now
glasszee [2k\]: in 6 minutes
playful [?\]: what kind of hardware alpha go playing on?
escudero [3k\]: 6 minutes? good
njs [1d\]: black looks like he is getting absolutely entirely rekt.
USSRMan [3d\]: google cloud
amadis [4k\]: what was that proverb, "fatten the pig" what?
alphago91: AGA's youtube channel?
Reym [-\]: zx81
glasszee [2k\]: you will have to find the USGO live channel to view advanced commentary
Ahamay [7d?\]: I'm worried since L15
LongLost [7k\]: He's having flash backs of the Korean war.
drueknmstr [3d\]: i think they said nintendo from 1988
USSRMan [3d\]: probably using a google super computer
tsukiatari [1d\]: poor lee sedol
gogonuts [4d\]: if aga doesn't hurry, b will have lost before they start
milkmilks: fatten the pig to sweeten the pot?
ccsco [1k\]: fatten the pig = don't kill it right away (make the group bigger first)
escudero [3k\]: I hope Kim don't start with the liberties also
icecream99 [1d?\]: What is b's plan?
Jermelle [?\]: l11 n10 
USSRMan [3d\]: internet can transfew data pretty fast
r0n1n [2d\]: keep on going with l11 ?
Tictactoe [-\]: 1012 cpu and several gpu i heard, but it is on websites that background info
icecream99 [1d?\]: Looks very tough for b
hondra [1d?\]: S. Korea has some of the fastest internet connection speeds on average
Azal [2d\]: .
Moose [2d\]: myungwan starts commentary in 5 minutes, right?
Deft1 [5k\]: this is a brutal fight, nothing is alive, nothing definitely dead, it's all up in the air

USSRMan [3d\]: why can't alphago run on google's super computer
julbla [4k\]: l11 n10
hurluberlu [3k\]: G16 vital
USSRMan [3d\]: use ever computational power available
tsukiatari [1d\]: it's not up in the air
julbla [4k\]: that's the game
shashwat [7k?\]: black giving up e18?
tsukiatari [1d\]: white is gaining
hurluberlu [3k\]: not much left for b
annago [?\]: lol @ "google's super computer"
shashwat [7k?\]: f118?
longbaby [?\]: if everyone of us begins to use our own cloud now, alpha would surely lose for lack of space
Zonked [2d\]: alphago is running on googles new top secret 10k qbit quantum computer
rsun [-\]: this is the only game on kgs where 100% of the kibitz is about the game
KobeGote [6k?\]: lol
julbla [4k\]: l11 n10
sai1029 [6d\]: lol
aham [8k\]: n18? it's for lose the game?

test1234 [-\]: Younggil An 8p: It’s hard to say who’s winning yet.  The flow of the game seems to be smooth for White so far.

BobWhoosta [2d\]: Now only 99.9%, there was one kibitz about the kibitzing, and one about that kibitz.
Moose [2d\]: idk, i saw some kibitz about lee sedol's haircut

c137: LSD resigns in 20moves
rsun [-\]: guys, just count the number of 2nd line stones for each player
USSRMan [3d\]: look at left side
manifolds [1d\]: corner still open
USSRMan [3d\]: white clearly better
rsun [-\]: w is leading big
Jermelle [?\]: But the left side is huge
adfafdsfaf: p18 seems so slow though, just for life.
hondra [1d?\]: Lee looks marginally better now than he did 20 moves ago
BobWhoosta [2d\]: N11 group is a little weak, so I think the game is still balanced at least.
kdbaby14 [6k\]: L-18?
probe [-\]: are aga/usgo uploading their commentary after the game or are they already running?
leachy [2k\]: does noone seem to notice that w p14 group looks pretty dead?

Deft1 [5k\]: f17 so lonely, can it possibly be saved?
KobeGote [6k?\]: Is that an iphone I hear in the background?
longbaby [?\]: w is leading
zavion [2k\]: aga announced it will start 1h later, that would be in 2 min, just wait a little bit :)

drwhois [2k\]: skynet
BobWhoosta [2d\]: How is black going to handle the H14 stones?
kadoban [?\]: Deft1: There's certainly a huge amount of aji in the corner for sure.
Long [?\]: link for advance commentary
kadoban [?\]: Deft1: But I think black is too busy at the moment to do that.
glasszee [2k\]: i'd rather take w
cjb: any general comments from high level players about which side's ahead?
rsun [-\]: w ahead
rsun [-\]: just count # 2nd line stones
LordVader [1k\]: w chickening out :)
drwhois [2k\]: w playing at 9p level?
Tictactoe [-\]: m7 seems played
Moose [2d\]: Lee's strategy might be to get behind early, which tends to make bots play really bad moves
glasszee [2k\]: aha--if w's p12 group gets longer than 13 stones across, alphago is unable to calculate it's L+D status
njs [1d\]: Im so happy that this will get more people interested in go

r0n1n [2d\]: yep, m7

gogonuts [4d\]: lee getting smushed bit by bit - can't recover from the bad initial fighting position

Naphthalin [10k?\]: m4 played
kolorek [3k?\]: did p18 dieded?
LongLost [7k\]: Out of synch stone placement -- powerful.

Ukasuhs [?\]: black would not use p17 to live
easyrobot [2k\]: R5
USSRMan [3d\]: nvm p17 bad move
USSRMan [3d\]: damages corner
USSRMan [3d\]: but either way, n17 doesnt kill
okc0nde: why bad? :)
saiiiiiii: dramatic hikaru no go would be very appropriate now.
saiiiiiii: +music
njs [1d\]: asd
okc0nde: yeah i know but n17 p17 o16 and?
USSRMan [3d\]: p17 will induce q16 which is bad for black's corner
okc0nde: q16 or m18?
doodooface [2d\]: P17 hreatens Q15 and O16
Blondin [4k\]: Sai os alive and he found alpha ;)
TheWolf [2d\]: what about h13 ?
Ukasuhs [?\]: if white actually plays n17, black can just answer with m18
USSRMan [3d\]: but p17 is still a bad move
AnnieHT [1k\]: black could play O16 when white N17
njs [1d\]: Can lee actually kill this rando stando?
clam [?\]: I love on Youtube "Inside Deep Mind - Nature video"
TheWolf [2d\]: that upper right b group is alive people
adius [17k?\]: engineers probably couldnt tell you much hah
TheWolf [2d\]: nothing kills it
Jermelle [?\]: m3 
okc0nde: yup that why i line w n17
rsun [-\]: after 70+ moves, lee only has 15-20 points
USSRMan [3d\]: black will attack l8 stones
okc0nde: like

;B[lq]C[rsun [-\]: can you believe that?
Jermelle [?\]: Lee is gonna be reduced pretty heavy in a second
samoht [2k\]: 625; whats the kgs-high?
Jsnake [?\]: O9 soon?
aham [8k\]: pépère
kadoban [?\]: I'm sure there is way to peek into alphago's evaluation at various times, adius.
okc0nde: n17 p17 o16 w can change
USSRMan [3d\]: h8?
Tictactoe [-\]: we had demo attracting onethousand viewers on kgs before

okc0nde: if b q16 b m18
Naphthalin [10k?\]: it's 6:24 am in europe
klausP [2d?\]: benni, welche Seite willst du haben?
eatramen [?\]: @tictactoe for what game?
Naphthalin [10k?\]: so probably some more will join us in the next hour
Moose [2d\]: lee has exactly as many points as he had 50 moves ago, when we all thought he gained too much on the right
adfafdsfaf: J7 so big.
r0n1n [2d\]: for a super early european time, 625 is a lot
rsun [-\]: R5 severe
doodooface [2d\]: need to see how white negotiates out the K8 stones without affecting H12 too much
wry [3d\]: 6:24pm here, I live in the future
okc0nde: so what hapen with why n17?
Reym [-\]: we need a lot of big kos

;W[mq]C[Ukasuhs [?\]: n17 m18 does not damage black
feeldabern [4d\]: w is unlikely to save k8
USSRMan [3d\]: cant black just m18
Azal [2d\]: J7 kinda tooo safe?
Uberdude [2d\]: 5:26 here in europe
Ukasuhs [?\]: black will never be forced to play p17 to live
feeldabern [4d\]: but b won't get a lot of points capturing k8
Jermelle [?\]: j7 
r0n1n [2d\]: funny how the supa mega bot 10p is pushing behind
Uberdude [2d\]: im from the past
escudero [3k\]: 2:26 in argentina

Ahamay [7d?\]: very complicated game, but I believe w is ahead
danielhast [?\]:  ?p bot doesn't care about proverbs
]
;B[im]C[USSRMan [3d\]: black should j7?
KobeGote [6k?\]: Lee maybe got in trouble because of the proverb about the hane and the knight's move
aham [8k\]: pkoi tout est prévisible?
Azal [2d\]: J7 seems too safe 
drwhois [2k\]: why lee sedol played r8?
tasuki [-\]: Ahamay, more commentary, please :)
rsun [-\]: the only proverb that matters is, defeat the champion to become champion
USSRMan [3d\]: i think it is necessary
USSRMan [3d\]: otherwise, 2 not live groups
magemax2 [13k\]: parce que t'es pro :)
drueknmstr [3d\]: i think lee is beyond proverbs
feeldabern [4d\]: if b doesn't capture the 2 stones, then w will pull them out and force m3 to live
glasszee [2k\]: @drwhois: redmond argued r8 was to escape the database of alphago
feeldabern [4d\]: then attac k9 force to live
feeldabern [4d\]: then s18 lives for w
icecream99 [1d?\]: couldn't J7 be a wider net?
Jsnake [?\]: This game is an eternity to the bot
JohnNothaf [23k\]: big net....
njs [1d\]: no
njs [1d\]: Big net is worse later
USSRMan [3d\]: this is the best net 
Ahamay [7d?\]: sorry I'm mostly listening to Kim Myungwan's commentary :)

Ahamay [7d?\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s

MarcoRubio: Black looks so far ahead...
Sigrosa [7k\]: best of 5? thanks.

kirtar [23k?\]: just like you're ahead in the polls? :v
yoda [1k\]: black is loosing
njs [1d\]: and I probably said it before he played it lol..
Answer3 [9d?\]: I'm curious that Alphago's game getting worse when he is in byoyome period?
drueknmstr [3d\]: he had to step away to mourn the fall the humanity for a few minutes
Moose [2d\]: no, you literally played it right after it was shown on the stream lol
njs [1d\]: Probably not Answer. Alpha plays extremely fast
Moose [2d\]: said it*
Tictactoe [-\]: Garlock made a really messy positioning of stones, i got them all straight pointaccurate on the intersections
groobiest: R5 is a super exciting move
njs [1d\]: Well O.K. Moose — I don't have the stream open but feel free to think I do
okc0nde: why no one tell me what happen with w n17? :)
Answer3 [9d?\]: but he spend more time than Lee so far
aham [8k\]: ben0 is better than lee sedol
rsun [-\]: @njs, look at the fifth to last line under move 75 ;)
aham [8k\]: it's my opinion
ninegen [6k\]: lee sedol left to call ke jie and ask him about the next move
aham [8k\]: lee sedol in this game
kafkaesque [-\]: lol
njs [1d\]: Lol nice rsun
njs [1d\]: lee will have to play q5 I would think
drueknmstr [3d\]: n17 nothing okc0nde, too small for b, if w there b can always r18

Yumi [7d?\]: i don't think that's how it works, PlasmaFlux
okc0nde: thx drue :)
rsun [-\]: now lee has 10s less than alpha
TAPJoshua [?\]: Alphago does not consume even a tiny fraction of Google's datacenters
Moose [2d\]: power grids worldwide go out as alphago computes next move
Tictactoe [-\]: Sedol is obviously counting the board
alphago91: was r5 played before sedol took a break?
PlasmaFlux [5k\]: ...yet... 
Parklane [7k?\]: f3 on the stream
easyrobot [2k\]: C17 still work , i mean later ?

GoIngo [?\]: f4 by wwhite

;W[fp]C[PlasmaFlux [5k\]: Why has this diverted from kifu?

leachy [2k\]: heh :) @ mickey mouse comment
PlasmaFlux [5k\]: Surprising how fast both are playing
murky [?\]: now bot play like a bot
aham [8k\]: they are artist
Nick23 [1d\]: G13 was mentioned by Myungwan 9p, he actually wanted to play it already earlier. I don't think it's as big of a mistake as everyone says. Maybe the timing a little strange
Reym [-\]: google will get trouble with disney for copyrights
USSRMan [3d\]: white will show its skill at sabaki
Long [?\]: what is ke jie saying
aham [8k\]: me too i said g13
oldguy [4d\]: somehow, when I watch a pro vs pro game, I couldn't understand many moves, but in this game, the moves are easy to read
aham [8k\]: i'm really 8k
rsun [-\]: alpha is genius
rsun [-\]: dom needs to watch this
Tictactoe [-\]: maybe bots are making humans stronger at go oldguy
feeldabern [4d\]: ^^
feeldabern [4d\]: dom would like these attach
rsun [-\]: alpha cut g3
glasszee [2k\]: "right now, white is very strong by playing g13" - AGA official commentary
]
;W[gq]C[zeven [?\]: Timing of G13 definitely looked strange from a human perspective, after the approach on the corner, but maybe it was actually the biggest move on the board
shashwat [7k?\]: link?
Azal [2d\]: woa w really fighting a lot
mgrneluka [8k\]: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s
USSRMan [3d\]: sabaki
wry [3d\]: well, no one is going to argue that g13 didn't make the group very strong I think :)
glasszee [2k\]: sabaki
CSanders: if g13 was so good sedol wouldve played it
oldguy [4d\]: I love computer go
asdfasdf: how is it biggest? it should work or it shouldn't work right?
USSRMan [3d\]: very hard to attack white
CSanders: f3 didnt change anything
ArcticDawn [6k\]: so right now it's human Lee Sedol vs a computer?
Koons [?\]: weiqitv saying white is leading
milkmilks: the black n18 group can live right? does r18 link it up safely?
Onirik [3d\]: It's not strange for human, it's strange for weak player we are
zeven [?\]: human Lee Sedol vs robot Lee Sedol
ArcticDawn [6k\]: whaaaa?
easyrobot [2k\]: i am robot
ScarletFox [?\]: black n18 area is alive through either N14 or R18 yes
grout: so if w g13 consolidates the upper left, if w makes the lower left live, then w wins?
ArcticDawn [6k\]: wow this must be a super computer
Moose [2d\]: really? myungwan was saying black is leading
Hollowb55 [11k\]: Gojira vs Mecha Gojira! xD
oldguy [4d\]: those programs always play genius moves that's rarely seen in human games
easyrobot [2k\]: i am robot
Trevoke [?\]: FYI Michael Redmond is going through variations and showing things that might be of interest to us all, though he *is* managing to keep it surprisingly approachable
robsclone: do you think when people study these games, we'll learn anything "new" about Go?
fldkg: no
USSRMan [3d\]: well g13 is just something humans ignore because it is counter intuitive
icecream99 [1d?\]: I think Myungwan was saying that W lost some ground after L8, but he can't tell if B is winning
playerx [1k?\]: myungwan seems to think w leading imo
CSanders: because it means f3 was a bad move
MarcoRubio: the other dude talking next to redmond needs to stop pretending he knows what he's talking about 
kadoban [?\]: He seems pretty unsure of who is leading at the moment.
highhand [5k\]: AlphaGo ever competed with the bots on KGS? How strong is AlphaGo compared to the 5d Go bots
MarcoRubio: it's really starting to bother me
puerhista [1d\]: Redmond is cool....the other guy is a bit annoying
leachy [2k\]: e4 e3 f5 f5 f2 d5 
rsun [-\]: when I see a move like g13 in my bot games, I know I will lose by 0.5
glasszee [2k\]: wow, allegedly this is an entirely new pattern
Tictactoe [-\]: Chris garlock is a fairly good player
USSRMan [3d\]: lol maybe to pros, i see this all the time
asdfasdf: its just seems confusing because if black could do something at h14, shouldn't it have been covered earlier
CSanders: exactly
CSanders: thats just basic logic
igoAggie [2k\]: highhand, this bot is much stronger.
oldguy [4d\]: Alphago is at pro level highhand, those kgs robots cannot compare with it
adamb1: alphago can beat zen and crazystone with a 4 stone handicap
glasszee [2k\]: maybe this is kgs move--it used kgs databse anyway lol
Ahamay [7d?\]: puerhista: Just switch to the AGA stream for strong players, this one is for beginners
aham [8k\]: e3?
LordVader [1k\]: I wonder how they will comment for the 2nd game ; hopefully they can skip the "I am going to explain how to capture a stone" part
leachy [2k\]: kgs database contains a lot of new moves no doubt
MarcoRubio: link to AGA stream?
kadoban [?\]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s
bolb [-\]:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPKR7HzM_s

adfafdsfaf: over 83000 people watching deepmind stream. only 1300 watching AGA. :(
asdfasdf: ^that name
okc0nde: f2
Tictactoe [-\]: speculations on alphago beating zen on H3 are fairly strange
glasszee [2k\]: alphago latest tactic: ultimate troll
CSanders: dont believe in hype
Trevoke [?\]: Well, the 1300 are people on AGA are people who will understand high-level commentary
Onirik [3d\]: Aga stream is so good x)
feeldabern [4d\]: alphago already beat zen on 4 handi though xD
aham [8k\]: f2 pas mal
asdfasdf: what level is the aga commentary?
USSRMan [3d\]: "alphago just played like a pro"
USSRMan [3d\]: according to redmond
mgrneluka [8k\]: 9p

sai1029 [6d\]: i would never see that move
asdfasdf: the deepmind stream is too low level, aga too high level
glasszee [2k\]: asdfasdf i feel your pain

aham [8k\]: d2
Jermelle [?\]: lol
okc0nde: f2 good
ArcticDawn [6k\]: whoa so this is a landmark of the AI vs human go game!
USSRMan [3d\]: g3
ArcticDawn [6k\]: Is this game 1?
ihmsje [-\]: where is the AGA live stream???
okc0nde: good for def and attack
Tictactoe [-\]: so estimated alphago to be [8d\] at kgs seems more accurate
ArcticDawn [6k\]: News says there are 5 games?
kadoban [?\]: The booming sound of played moves is pretty hilarious on the AGA stream
adamb1: google says in its paper that alphago played against crazystone and zen with a 4 stone handicap and won 77% and 86% of the games
nu [2k\]: who is winning
glasszee [2k\]: hilarious? forboding!
r0n1n [2d\]: keeping sente here seems important : still 2 unsettled corners
aham [8k\]: il peut essayer de se faire un groupe dans le coin
USSRMan [3d\]: there are so many possibilities here
USSRMan [3d\]: because of all this forcing moves
Tictactoe [-\]: several players think white has managed to get a marginal lead
USSRMan [3d\]: lets see what a supercomputer can do
aham [8k\]: r3
aham [8k\]: ou d17
cxcv: Essentially I think the two programs ain't comparable with each other since they deploy different algorithms

;W[co]C[Long [?\]: this is like classical chinese go
Hellhuman [1d?\]: good morning everyone^^
zeven [?\]: The later it gets in the game, the more important it is for Sedol to have a clear lead
USSRMan [3d\]: another counter intuitive move
Blondin [4k\]: G5 amd the fighting spirit is in alpha
aham [8k\]: ko
okc0nde: b6 really?
CSanders: white can fight ko
JohnNothaf [23k\]: It looks like W's Moyo is a bit stronger than Bs. It seems to me at least. But then again: 23 kyu here

ArcticDawn [6k\]: Goooooooooo human!!!!

TAZZ [6k\]: +
ArcticDawn [6k\]: Lee is professional 9Dan! If he loses computer will soon dominate go.
UTDEspy [-\]: miai in connection to S18 or 2 eyes with p17 cut
ScarletFox [?\]: Did F4/G2 set gain anything for white after all that?  It looks more like it helped b
TAZZ [6k\]: abandon ship lol
ScarletFox [?\]: F4/G3
Onirik [3d\]: he's not just professionnal 9dan x)
rsun [-\]: ajahuang looks very cool
Ukasuhs [?\]: black would not use p17 to live, instead he would use the combination of n14 and o16 to make the 2nd eye
kadoban [?\]: Regardless of what happens, computers will soon dominate go. It's playing at at top professional level already and there's not much reason to believe that it's as good as it can get.
Trevoke [?\]: You know, I have to say, while it *is* very nice that Redmond is a fluent English speaker AND a 9P, it's kind of a shame that it's two white dudes in that screencast.
glasszee [2k\]: h6 area seems like highway robbery in a professional context
Tictactoe [-\]: Sedol is multi title holder, fairly stronger than most other 9p

glasszee [2k\]: w begins endgame?
Hellhuman [1d?\]: seems strong enough :p
TAZZ [6k\]: my 6dan teacher got beaten by 0.5
amadis [4k\]: i feel like michael redmond's commentary is more authoritative but maybe it's just because his english is better and the production values are better on the deepmind stream. i suppose the two of them must really be on about the same level of analysis
glasszee [2k\]: <___<
H [-\]: l2 
bavly [2k?\]: man when i started playing about 10 year ago the idea of a go bot being as strong as 1p was unheard of

cdocdo [2k\]: w m2  b l2
robvoigt [10k\]: where is myungwan kim commentating?
dsaun [-\]: redmond is a tournament pro
Tictactoe [-\]: very true, analyses in a native language mostly gain momentum

;W[lr]
;B[kr]C[bababobo [1d?\]: w can win easy if top left becomes territory
bavly [2k?\]: this ir rediculous the beauty of go was that it was so infinite in potential that bots would simply be unable to deal with it on high levels 
asdfasdf: deepmind stream puts a lot of time going over beginner terms
Jazzman [1d\]: when i startet, there was no internet :)

feeldabern [4d\]: oh n12 is same as o13
rubicon [-\]: bavly, like redmond explained, playing p17 q16 exchange would hurt right side
royu [4d\]: o16 better than p17 because of how p17 affects r16

vermouth [2d\]: is alphago really thinking or they just take time to put the stone?
griffin [4d\]: I don't get why n12
icecream99 [1d?\]: If w played n13, then that's equivalent to exchanging w n13 b o13 in this position

icecream99 [1d?\]: Redmond: "I'm not seeing obvious mistakes in AlphaGo's play today"
WinPooh [3k\]: Why does bot play with Lee Sedol and not Ke Jie? Sedol is not #1
rsun [-\]: they asked sedol first
icecream99 [1d?\]: (in comparison to last October's match against Fan, where he could see several obvious mistakes in real time)
Long [?\]: ke jie will get his pain soon
leachy [2k\]: because marketing
Azal [2d\]: lee thinking how to exploit o9
Yumi [7d?\]: lee sedol is a good choice to play against alphago
USSRMan [3d\]: Ke Jie is 18

TAZZ [6k\]: wher is the time limit?
gogonuts [4d\]: ke jie also wants to know :-)

KBAC [2d\]: Lee deserves this match more than any other
jellyroll: Lee Sedol considering vulcan neck pinch, but unsure it will work on robot
rsun [-\]: he gets a bonus on a per game basis for each win
Tictactoe [-\]: and the popularity of baduk in korea taken into account, sedol was a good choice to approach
bavly [2k?\]: p9?
rsun [-\]: and another bonus for just playing
Uberdude [2d\]: tictactoe, ke jie was in the spotlight since at least mid last year
kadoban [?\]: The whole 5 games get played regardless of if the match is decided early, right?
USSRMan [3d\]: p9 seems terrible
drueknmstr [3d\]: considering "spilling" his coffee on the computer. "oops"
Uberdude [2d\]: its simply that lee sedol is a legend
USSRMan [3d\]: so much bad aji
odnihs [-\]: it's 150k guaranteed+20k per game he wins, separate from the 1 million for winning the series
Uberdude [2d\]: ke jie is not yet

robvoigt [10k\]: but in the paper they describe one that runs on a normal computer and beats like 99% of existing programs
Uberdude [2d\]: i wonder if black could have made r4 q5 echange and then tenuki earlier
nopanic [4k\]: alphago est blanc, Lee Sedol est vert ;o)
Hellhuman [1d?\]: On what hardware is this alpha go running? is it more powerful than the set up against fanhui?
adamb1: 1202 CPUs and 176 GPUs
TAZZ [6k\]: the estimator is going into revolt
hondra [1d?\]: the october version ran on that
Uberdude [2d\]: that way q3 will not be killed by white o2

rubicon [-\]: has to s8
kittjn [1k\]: s8 r14?
rubicon [-\]: maybe s9
kadoban [?\]: The game is rarely different because of the ruleset.
gejimayu [2d?\]: will there be some trade at the side?
LongLost [7k\]: Alphago such an advantage in such constrained circumstances.
USSRMan [3d\]: better for computers because dont have to code in weird life death situations

USSRMan [3d\]: so kim missing something i bet
eatramen [?\]: lee is rocking back and forth, is that a normal habit or is he nervous?

icecream99 [1d?\]: Redmond is calling Q4 as a bad exchange
foofoo: leachy, that's for the version that beat fan hui, it uses 3x3 shape collection and 5x5 search matrix and iterates so in any evaluation alphago only 'sees' 13 intersections
